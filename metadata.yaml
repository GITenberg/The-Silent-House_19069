description: Lucian Denzil was a briefless barrister, who so far departed from the
  traditions of his brethren of the long robe as not to dwell within the purlieus
  of the Temple. For certain private reasons, not unconnected with economy, he occupied
  rooms in Geneva Square, Pimlico; and, for the purposes of his profession, repaired
  daily, from ten to four, to Serjeant's Inn, where he shared an office with a friend
  equally briefless and poor. This state of things sounds hardly enviable, but Lucian,
  being young and independent to the extent of L300 a year, was not dissatisfied with
  his position. As his age was only twenty-five, there was ample time, he thought,
  to succeed in his profession; and, pending that desirable consummation, he cultivated
  the muses on a little oatmeal, after the fashion of his kind. There have been lives
  less happily circumstanced. Geneva Square was a kind of backwater of the great river
  of town life which swept past its entrance with speed and clamour without disturbing
  the peace within. One long, narrow street led from a roaring thoroughfare into a
  silent quadrangle of tall grey houses, occupied by lodging-house keepers, city clerks
  and two or three artists, who represented the Bohemian element of the place. In
  the centre there was an oasis of green lawn.
