<h3>THE TENANT OF THE SILENT HOUSE</h3>


<p>Lucian Denzil was a briefless barrister, who
so far departed from the traditions of his brethren
of the long robe as not to dwell within the purlieus
of the Temple. For certain private reasons, not unconnected
with economy, he occupied rooms in Geneva
Square, Pimlico; and, for the purposes of his
profession, repaired daily, from ten to four, to Serjeant's
Inn, where he shared an office with a friend
equally briefless and poor.</p>

<p>This state of things sounds hardly enviable, but
Lucian, being young and independent to the extent
of &pound;300 a year, was not dissatisfied with his position.
As his age was only twenty-five, there was
ample time, he thought, to succeed in his profession;
and, pending that desirable consummation, he
cultivated the muses on a little oatmeal, after the
fashion of his kind. There have been lives less
happily circumstanced.</p>

<p>Geneva Square was a kind of backwater of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>great river of town life which swept past its entrance
with speed and clamour without disturbing
the peace within. One long, narrow street led from
a roaring thoroughfare into a silent quadrangle of
tall grey houses, occupied by lodging-house keepers,
city clerks and two or three artists, who represented
the Bohemian element of the place. In the
centre there was an oasis of green lawn, surrounded
by rusty iron railings the height of a man, dotted
with elms of considerable age, and streaked with
narrow paths of yellow gravel.</p>

<p>The surrounding houses represented an eminently
respectable appearance, with their immaculately
clean steps, white-curtained windows, and neat
boxes of flowers. The windows glittered like diamonds,
the door-knobs and plates shone with a yellow
lustre, and there were no sticks, or straws, or
waste paper lying about to mar the tidy look of the
square.</p>

<p>With one exception, Geneva Square was a pattern
of all that was desirable in the way of cleanliness
and order. One might hope to find such a
haven in some somnolent cathedral town, but scarcely
in the grimy, smoky, restless metropolis of
London.</p>

<p>The exception to the notable spotlessness of the
neighborhood was No. 13, a house in the centre of
the side opposite to the entrance. Its windows were
dusty, and without blinds or curtains, there were
no flower-boxes on the ledges, the steps lacked
whitewash, and the iron railings looked rusty for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>want of paint. Stray straws and scraps of paper
found their way down the area, where the cracked
pavement was damp with green slime. Such beggars
as occasionally wandered into the square, to
the scandal of its inhabitants, camped on the doorstep;
and the very door itself presented a battered,
dissolute appearance.</p>

<p>Yet, for all its ill looks and disreputable suggestions,
those who dwelt in Geneva Square would not
have seen it furbished up and occupied for any
money. They spoke about it in whispers, with
ostentatious tremblings, and daunted looks, for No.
13 was supposed to be haunted, and had been empty
for over twenty years. By reason of its legend, its
loneliness and grim appearance, it was known as
the Silent House, and formed quite a feature of
the place. Murder had been done long ago in one
of its empty, dusty rooms, and it was since then
that the victim walked. Lights, said the ghost-seers,
had been seen flitting from window to window,
groans were sometimes heard, and the apparition
of a little old woman in brocaded silk and high-heeled
shoes appeared on occasions. Hence the Silent
House bore an uncanny reputation.</p>

<p>How much truth there was in these stories it is
impossible to say; but sure enough, in spite of a low
rental, no tenant would take No. 13 and face its
ghostly terrors. House and apparition and legend
had become quite a tradition, when the whole fantasy
was ended in the summer of '95 by the unexpected
occupation of the mansion. Mr. Mark Ber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>win,
a gentleman of mature age, who came from
nobody knew where, rented No. 13, and established
himself therein to lead a strange and lonely life.</p>

<p>At first, the gossips, strong in ghostly tradition,
declared that the new tenant would not remain a
week in the house; but as the week extended into
six months, and Mr. Berwin showed no signs of
leaving, they left off speaking of the ghost and took
to discussing the man himself. In a short space of
time quite a collection of stories were told about the
newcomer and his strange ways.</p>

<p>Lucian heard many of these tales from his landlady.
How Mr. Berwin lived all alone in the Silent
House without servant or companion; how he spoke
to none, and admitted no one into the mansion; how
he appeared to have plenty of money, and was frequently
seen coming home more or less intoxicated;
and how Mrs. Kebby, the deaf charwoman who
cleaned out Mr. Berwin's rooms, declined to sleep
in the house because she considered that there was
something wrong about her employer.</p>

<p>To such gossip Denzil paid little attention, until
his skein of life became unexpectedly entangled with
that of the strange gentleman. The manner of their
meeting was unforeseen and peculiar.</p>

<p>One foggy November night, Lucian, returning
from the theatre, shortly after eleven o'clock, dismissed
his hansom at the entrance to the square and
walked thereinto through the thick mist, trusting to
find his way home by reason of two years' familiarity
with the precincts. As it was impossible to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>even the glare of the near gas lamp in the murky
air, Lucian felt his way cautiously along the railings.
The square was filled with fog, dense to
the eye and cold to the feel, so that Lucian shivered
with the chill, in spite of the fur coat over his evening
clothes.</p>

<p>As he edged gingerly along, and thought longingly
of the fire and supper awaiting him in his
comfortable rooms, he was startled by hearing a
deep, rich voice boom out almost at his feet. To
make the phenomenon still more remarkable, the
voice shaped itself into certain well-known words
of Shakespeare:</p>

<p>"Oh!" boomed this <i>vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil</i> in rather
husky tones, "Oh! that a man should put an
enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains!" And
then through the mist and darkness came the unmistakable
sound of sobs.</p>

<p>"God bless me!" cried Lucian, leaping back, with
shaken nerves. "Who is this? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A lost soul!" wailed the deep voice, "which
God will not bless!" And then came the sobbing
again.</p>

<p>It made Denzil's blood run cold to hear this
unseen creature weeping in the gloom. Moving
cautiously in the direction of the sound, he stumbled
against a man with his folded arms resting on the
railings, and his face bent down on his arms. He
made no attempt to turn when Lucian touched him,
but with downcast head continued to weep and
moan in a very frenzy of self-pity.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>"Here!" said the young barrister, shaking the
stranger by the shoulder, "what is the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>"Drink!" stuttered the man, suddenly turning
with a dramatic gesture. "I am an object lesson to
teetotalers; a warning to topers; a modern helot
made shameful to disgust youth with vice."</p>

<p>"You had better go home, sir," said Lucian
sharply.</p>

<p>"I can't find home. It is somewhere hereabout,
but where, I don't know."</p>

<p>"You are in Geneva Square," said Denzil, trying
to sharpen the dulled wits of the man.</p>

<p>"I wish I was in No. 13 of it," sighed the stranger.
"Where the deuce is No. 13? Not in this Cloudcuckooland,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Lucian, taking the man's arm.
"Come with me. I'll lead you home, Mr. Berwin."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the name passed his lips than the
stranger drew back suddenly, with a hasty exclamation.
Some suspicion seemed to engender a mixture
of terror and defiance which placed him on his
guard against undue intimacy, even when some undefined
fear was knocking at his heart. "Who are
you?" he demanded in a steadier tone. "How do
you know my name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Denzil, Mr. Berwin, and I live
in one of the houses of this square. As you mention
No. 13, I know you can be none other than
Mr. Mark Berwin, the tenant of the Silent House."</p>

<p>"The dweller in the haunted house," sneered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Berwin, evidently relieved, "who stays there with
ghosts, and worse than ghosts."</p>

<p>"Worse than ghosts?"</p>

<p>"The phantoms of my own sins, young man. I
have sowed folly, and now I am reaping the crop.
I am&mdash;&mdash;" Here his further speech was interrupted
by a fit of coughing, which shook his lean
figure severely. At its conclusion he was so exhausted
that he was forced to support himself against
the railings. "A portion of the crop," he murmured.</p>

<p>Lucian was sorry for the man, who seemed
scarcely capable of looking after himself, and he
thought it unwise to leave him in such a plight.
At the same time, he was impatient of lingering
in the heart of the clammy fog at such a late hour;
so, as his companion seemed indisposed to move, he
caught him again by the arm without ceremony.
The abrupt action seemed to waken again the fears
of Berwin.</p>

<p>"Where would you take me?" he asked, resisting
the gentle force used by Lucian.</p>

<p>"To your own house. You will be ill if you stay
here."</p>

<p>"You are not one of them?" asked the man suddenly.</p>

<p>"One of whom?"</p>

<p>"One of those who wish to harm me?"</p>

<p>Denzil began to think he had to do with a madman,
and to gain his ends he spoke to him in a soothing
manner, as he would to a child: "I wish to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>do you good, Mr. Berwin," said he gently. "Come
to your home."</p>

<p>"Home! home! Ah, God, I have no home!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he gathered himself together, and
with his arm in that of his guide, stumbled along
in the thick, chill mist. Lucian knew the position
of No. 13 well, as it almost faced the lodgings
occupied by himself, and by skirting the railings
with due caution, he managed to half lead, half drag
his companion to the house. When they stood before
the door, and Berwin had assured himself that
he was actually home by the use of his latch-key,
Denzil wished him a curt good-night. "And I
should advise you to go to bed at once," he concluded,
turning to descend the steps.</p>

<p>"Don't go! Don't go!" cried Berwin, seizing
the young man by the arm. "I am afraid to go
in by myself&mdash;all is so dark and cold! Wait until
I get a light!"</p>

<p>As the creature's nerves seemed to be unhinged
by over-indulgence in alcohol, and he stood gasping
and shivering on the threshold like some beaten
animal, Lucian took compassion on him.</p>

<p>"I'll see you indoors," said he, and striking a
match, stepped into the darkness after the man. The
hall of No. 13 seemed to be almost as cold as the
world without, and the trifling glimmer of the lucifer
served rather to reveal than dispel the surrounding
darkness. The light, as it were, hollowed a
gulf out of the tremendous gloom and made the
house tenfold more ghostly than before. The foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>steps
of Denzil and Berwin sounding on the bare
boards&mdash;for the hall was uncarpeted&mdash;waked hollow
echoes, and when they paused the silence which
ensued seemed almost menacing. The grim reputation
of the mansion, its gloom and silence, appealed
powerfully to the latent superstition of Lucian.
How much more nearly, then, would it touch
the shaken and excited nerves of the tragic drunkard
who dwelt continually amid its terrors!</p>

<p>Berwin opened a door on the right-hand side of
the hall and turned up the light of a handsome oil-lamp
which had been screwed down pending his
arrival. This lamp was placed on a small square
table covered with a white cloth and a dainty cold
supper. The young barrister noted that the napery,
cutlery, and crystal were all of the finest; that the
viands were choice; that champagne and claret were
the beverages. Evidently Berwin was a luxurious
gentleman and indulgent to his appetites.</p>

<p>Lucian tried to gain a long look at him in the
mellow light, but Berwin kept his face turned away,
and seemed as anxious now for his visitor to go
as he had been for him to enter. Denzil, quick in
comprehension, took the hint at once.</p>

<p>"I'll go now, as you have the light burning,"
said he. "Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night," replied Berwin shortly, and added
to his discourtesy by letting Lucian find his way
out alone.</p>

<p>And so ended the barrister's first meeting with
the strange tenant of the Silent House.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>SHADOWS ON THE BLIND</h3>


<p>The landlady of Denzil was a rather uncommon
specimen of the class. She inclined to plumpness,
was lively in the extreme, wore very fashionable
garments of the brightest colours, and&mdash;although
somewhat elderly&mdash;still cherished a hope
that some young man would elevate her to the rank
of a matron.</p>

<p>At present, Miss Julia Greeb was an unwedded
damsel of forty summers, who, with the aid of art,
was making desperate but ineffectual efforts to detain
the youth which was slipping from her. She
pinched her waist, dyed her hair, powdered her
face, and affected juvenile dress of the white frock
and blue sash kind. In the distance she looked a
girlish twenty; close at hand various artifices aided
her to pass for thirty; and it was only in the solitude
of her own room that her real age was apparent.
Never did woman wage a more resolute
fight with Time than did Miss Greeb.</p>

<p>But this was the worst and most frivolous side
of her character, for she was really a good-hearted,
cheery little woman, with a brisk manner, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
flow of talk unequalled in Geneva Square. She had
been born in the house she occupied, after the death
of her father, and had grown up to assist her mother
in ministering to the exactions of a continuous
procession of lodgers. These came and went, married
and died; but not one of the desirable young
men had borne Miss Greeb to the altar, so that
when her mother died the fair Julia almost despaired
of attaining to the dignity of wifehood.
Nevertheless, she continued to keep boarders, and
to make attempts to captivate the hearts of such
bachelors as she judged weak in character.</p>

<p>Hitherto all her efforts had been more or less
of a mercantile character, with an eye to money;
but when Lucian Denzil appeared on the scene, the
poor little woman really fell in love with his handsome
face. But, in strange contrast to her other
efforts, Miss Greeb never for a moment deemed
that Lucian would marry her. He was her god,
her ideal of manhood, and to him she offered worship,
and burnt incense after the manner of her
kind.</p>

<p>Denzil occupied a bedroom and sitting-room,
both pleasant, airy apartments, looking out on to
the square. Miss Greeb attended to his needs herself,
and brought up his breakfast with her own
fair hands, happy for the day if her admired lodger
conversed with her for a few moments before reading
the morning paper. Then Miss Greeb would
retire to her own sitting-room and indulge in day
dreams which she well knew would never be real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ised.
The romances she wove herself were even
more marvellous than those she read in her favourite
penny novelettes; but, unlike the printed tales,
her romance never culminated in marriage. Poor
brainless, silly, pitiful Miss Greeb; she would have
made a good wife and a fond mother, but by some
irony of fate she was destined to be neither; and the
comedy of her husband-hunting youth was now
changing into the lonely tragedy of disappointed
spinsterhood. She was one of the world's unknown
martyrs, and her fate merits tears rather than laughter.</p>

<p>On the morning after his meeting with Berwin,
the young barrister sat at breakfast, with Miss
Greeb in anxious attendance. Having poured out
his tea, and handed him his paper, and ascertained
that his breakfast was to his liking, Miss Greeb
lingered about the room, putting this straight and
that crooked, in the hope that Lucian would converse
with her. In this she was gratified, as Denzil
wished to learn details about the strange man he
had assisted on the previous night, and he knew
that no one could afford him more precise information
than his brisk landlady, to whom was known
all the gossip of the neighbourhood. His first word
made Miss Greeb flutter back to the table like a
dove to its nest.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about No. 13?" asked
Lucian, stirring his tea.</p>

<p>"Do I know anything about No. 13?" repeated
Miss Greeb in shrill amazement. "Of course I do,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Mr. Denzil. There ain't a thing I don't know
about that house. Ghosts and vampires and crawling
spectres live in it&mdash;that they do."</p>

<p>"Do you call Mr. Berwin a ghost?"</p>

<p>"No; nor nothing half so respectable. He is
a mystery, sir, that's what Mr. Berwin is, and I
don't care if he hears me commit myself so far."</p>

<p>"In what way is he a mystery?" demanded Denzil,
approaching the matter with more particularity.</p>

<p>"Why," said Miss Greeb, evidently puzzled how
to answer this leading question, "no one can find out
anything about him. He's full of secrets and underhand
goings on. It ain't respectable not to be
fair and above board&mdash;that it ain't."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why a quiet-living old gentleman
should tell his private affairs to the whole
square," remarked Lucian drily.</p>

<p>"Those who have nothing bad to conceal needn't
be afraid of speaking out," retorted Miss Greeb
tartly. "And the way in which Mr. Berwin lives
is enough to make one think him a coiner, or a
thief, or even a murderer&mdash;that it is!"</p>

<p>"But what grounds have you to believe him any
one of the three?"</p>

<p>This question also puzzled the landlady, as she
had no reasonable grounds for her wild statements.
Nevertheless, she made a determined attempt to
substantiate them by hearsay evidence. "Mr. Berwin,"
said she in significant tones, "lives all alone
in that haunted house."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p><p>"Why not? Every man has the right to be a
misanthrope if he chooses."</p>

<p>"He has no right to behave so, in a respectable
square," replied Miss Greeb, shaking her head.
"There's only two rooms of that large house furnished,
and all the rest is given up to dust and
ghosts. Mr. Berwin won't have a servant to live
under his roof, and Mrs. Kebby, who does his charing,
says he drinks awful. Then he has his meals
sent in from the Nelson Hotel round the corner,
and eats them all alone. He don't receive no letters,
he don't read no newspapers, and stays in all
day, only coming out at night, like an owl. If he
ain't a criminal, Mr. Denzil, why does he carry
on so?"</p>

<p>"He may dislike his fellow-men, and desire to
live a secluded life."</p>

<p>Miss Greeb still shook her head. "He may
dislike his fellow-men," she said with emphasis,
"but that don't keep him from seeing them&mdash;ah!
that it don't."</p>

<p>"Is there anything wrong in that?" said Lucian,
contemptuous of these cobweb objections.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Mr. Denzil; but where do those
he sees come from?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Miss Greeb?"</p>

<p>"They don't go in by the front door, that's certain,"
continued the little woman darkly. "There's
only one entrance to this square, sir, and Blinders,
the policeman, is frequently on duty there. Two
or three nights he's met Mr. Berwin coming in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>after dark and exchanged friendly greetings with
him, and each time Mr. Berwin has been alone!"</p>

<p>"Well! well! What of that?" said Denzil impatiently.</p>

<p>"This much, Mr. Denzil, that Blinders has gone
round the square, after seeing Mr. Berwin, and has
seen shadows&mdash;two or three of them&mdash;on the sitting-room
blind. Now, sir," cried Miss Greeb,
clinching her argument, "if Mr. Berwin came into
the square alone, how did his visitors get in?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps by the back," conjectured Lucian.</p>

<p>Again Miss Greeb shook her head. "I know
the back of No. 13 as well as I know my own
face," she declared. "There's a yard and a fence,
but no entrance. To get in there you have to go
in by the front door or down the aiery steps; and
you can't do neither without coming past Blinders
at the square's entrance, and that," finished Miss
Greeb triumphantly, "these visitors don't do."</p>

<p>"They may have come into the square during the
day, when Blinders was not on duty."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Miss Greeb, ready for this objection.
"I thought of that myself, and as my duty
to the square I have inquired&mdash;that I have. On
two occasions I've asked the day policeman, and he
says no one passed."</p>

<p>"Then," said Lucian, rather puzzled, "Mr. Berwin
cannot live alone in the house."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, I'm sure," cried the pertinacious
woman, "but he does. Mrs. Kebby has
been all over the house, and there isn't another soul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>in it. No, Mr. Denzil, take it what way you will,
there's something that ain't right about Mr. Berwin&mdash;if
that's his real name, which I don't believe
it is."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Greeb?"</p>

<p>"Just because I don't," replied the landlady, with
feminine logic. "And if you think of having anything
to do with this mystery, Mr. Denzil, I beg
of you not to, else you may come to something as
is too terrible to consider&mdash;that you may."</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," cried Miss Greeb, tossing
her head and gliding towards the door. "It ain't
for me to say what I think. I am the last person
in the world to meddle with what don't concern
me&mdash;that I am." And thus ending the conversation,
Miss Greeb vanished, with significant look and
pursed-up lips.</p>

<p>The reason of this last speech and rapid retreat
lay in the fact that Miss Greeb could bring no tangible
charge against her opposite neighbour; and
therefore hinted at his complicity in all kinds of
horrors, which she was quite unable to define save
in terms more or less vague.</p>

<p>Lucian dismissed such hints of criminality from
his mind as the outcome of Miss Greeb's very lively
imagination; yet, even though he reduced her communications
to bare facts, he could not but acknowledge
that there was something queer about Mr. Berwin
and his mode of life. The man's self-pity and
self-condemnation; his hints that certain people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>wished to do him harm; the curious episode of the
shadows on the blind&mdash;these things engaged the
curiosity of Denzil in no ordinary degree; and he
could not but admit to himself that it would greatly
ease his mind to arrive at some reasonable explanation
of Berwin's eccentricities.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he held that he had no right to
pry into the secrets of the stranger, and honourably
strove to dismiss the tenant of No. 13 and
his tantalising environments from his mind. But
such dismissal of unworthy curiosity was more difficult
to effect than he expected.</p>

<p>For the next week Lucian resolutely banished
the subject from his thoughts, and declined to discuss
the matter further with Miss Greeb. That
little woman, all on fire with curiosity, made various
inquiries of her gossips regarding the doings
of Mr. Berwin, and in default of reporting the
same to her lodger, occupied herself in discussing
them with her neighbours. The consequence of
this incessant gossip was that the eyes of the whole
square fixed themselves on No. 13 in expectation
of some catastrophe, although no one knew exactly
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>This undefinable feeling of impending disaster
communicating itself to Lucian, stimulated his curiosity
to such a pitch that, with some feeling of
shame for his weakness, he walked round the square
on two several evenings in the hope of meeting
Berwin. But on both occasions he was unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p><p>On the third evening he was more fortunate, for
having worked at his law books until late at night,
he went out for a brisk walk before retiring to
rest. The night was cold, and there had been a
slight fall of snow, so Lucian wrapped himself up
well, lighted his pipe, and proceeded to take the
air by tramping twice or thrice round the square.
Overhead the sky was clear and frosty, with chill
glittering stars and a wintry moon. A thin covering
of snow lay on the pavement, and there was
a white rime on the bare branches of the central
trees.</p>

<p>On coming to the house of Berwin, the barrister
saw that the sitting-room was lighted up and the
curtains undrawn, so that the window presented a
square of illuminated blind. Even as he looked,
two shadows darkened the white surface&mdash;the shadows
of a man and a woman. Evidently they had
come between the lamp and the window, and so,
quite unknowingly, revealed their actions to the
watcher. Curious to see the end of this shadow
pantomime, Lucian stood still and looked intently
at the window.</p>

<p>The two figures seemed to be arguing, for their
heads nodded violently and their arms waved constantly.
They retreated out of the sphere of light,
and again came into it, still continuing their furious
gestures. Unexpectedly the male shadow seized
the female by the throat and swung her like a feather
to and fro. The struggling figures reeled out of
the radiance and Lucian heard a faint cry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p><p>Thinking that something was wrong, he rushed
up the steps and rang the bell violently. Almost
before the sound died away the light in the room
was extinguished, and he could see nothing more.
Again and again he rang, but without attracting
attention; so Lucian finally left the house and went
in search of Blinders, the policeman, to narrate his
experience. At the entrance of Geneva Square he
ran against a man whom he recognised in the clear
moonlight.</p>

<p>To his surprise he beheld Mark Berwin.</p>

<h3>AN UNSATISFACTORY EXPLANATION</h3>


<p>"Mr. Berwin!" cried Lucian, recognising the
man. "Is it you?"</p>

<p>"Who else should it be?" replied Berwin, bending
forward to see who had jostled him. "Who
else should it be, Mr. Denzil?"</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;I thought," said the barrister,
unable to conceal his surprise, "that is, I fancied you
were indoors."</p>

<p>"Your fancy was wrong, you see. I am not
indoors."</p>

<p>"Then who is in your house?"</p>

<p>Berwin shrugged his shoulders. "No one, so
far as I know."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, sir. There was a light in
your room, and I saw the shadows of a man and a
woman struggling together thrown on the blind."</p>

<p>"People in my house!" said Berwin, laying a
shaking hand on the arm of Lucian. "Impossible!"</p>

<p>"I tell you it is so!"</p>

<p>"Come, then, and we will look for them," said
Berwin in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"But they have gone by this time!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p><p>"Gone!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Denzil rapidly. "I rang the bell,
as I fancied there was some fatal quarrel going on
within. At once the light was put out, and as I
could attract no one to the door, I suppose the man
and woman must have fled."</p>

<p>For a moment or so Berwin said nothing, but
his grip on Lucian's arm relaxed, and he moved
forward a few steps. "You must be mistaken, Mr.
Denzil," said he in altered tones, "there can be no
person in my house. I locked the door before I
went out, and I have been absent at least two
hours."</p>

<p>"Then I must be mad, or dreaming!" retorted
Lucian, with heat.</p>

<p>"We can soon prove if you are either of the
two, sir. Come with me and examine the house
for yourself."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Denzil, drawing back, "it
is none of my business. But I warn you, Mr. Berwin,
that others are more curious than I am. Several
times people have been known to be in your
house while you were absent, and your mode of
life, secretive and strange, does not commend itself
to the householders in this neighbourhood. If you
persist in giving rise to gossip and scandal, some
busybody may bring the police on the scene."</p>

<p>"The police!" echoed the old man, now greatly
alarmed, as would appear from his shaking voice.
"No! no! That will never do! My house is my
castle! The police dare not break into it! I am a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>peaceful and very unfortunate gentleman, who
wishes to live quietly. All this talk of people being
in my house is nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Yet you seemed afraid when I told you of the
shadows," said Lucian pointedly.</p>

<p>"Afraid! I am afraid of nothing!"</p>

<p>"Not even of those who are after you?" hinted
Denzil, recalling the conversation of the previous
occasion.</p>

<p>Berwin gave a kind of eldritch shriek and
stepped back a pace, as though to place himself on
his guard. "What&mdash;what do you know about such&mdash;such
things?" he panted.</p>

<p>"Only so much as you hinted at when I last saw
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I was not myself on that night. The
wine was in and the wit was out."</p>

<p>"The truth also, it would seem," said Lucian
drily, "judging by your agitation then and now."</p>

<p>"I am an unfortunate gentleman," whimpered
Berwin tremulously.</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me, sir, I shall leave you,"
said Lucian ceremoniously. "It seems to be my
fate to hold midnight conversations with you in
the cold, but I think this one had better be cut
short."</p>

<p>"One moment," Mr. Berwin exclaimed. "You
have been good enough to place me on my guard as
to the talk my quiet course of life is causing. Pray
add to your kindness by coming with me to my
house and exploring it from attic to basement. You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>will then see that there are no grounds for scandal,
and that the shadows you fancy you saw on the
blind are not those of real people."</p>

<p>"They can't be those of ghosts, at all events,"
replied Lucian, "as I never heard, to my knowledge,
that spirits could cast shadows."</p>

<p>"Well, come and see for yourself that the house
is empty."</p>

<p>Warmly as this invitation was given, Lucian had
some scruples about accepting it. To explore an
almost unfurnished mansion with a complete stranger&mdash;and
one with an ill reputation&mdash;at the midnight
hour, is not an enterprise to be coveted by
any man, however bold he may be. Still, Lucian
had ample courage, and more curiosity, for the adventure,
as the chance of it stirred up that desire
for romance which belongs peculiarly to youth.
Also he was anxious to satisfy himself concerning
the blind shadows, and curious to learn why Berwin
inhabited so dismal and mysterious a mansion. Add
to these reasons a keen pleasure in profiting by the
occurrence of the unexpected, and you will guess
that Denzil ended by accepting the strange invitation
of Berwin.</p>

<p>Being now fully committed to the adventure, he
went forward with cool courage and an observant
eye, to spy out, if possible, the secret upon which
hinged these mysteries.</p>

<p>As on the former occasion, Berwin inducted his
guest into the sitting-room, and here, as previously,
a dainty supper was spread. Berwin turned up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>the lamp light and waved his hand round the luxuriously
furnished room, pointing particularly to
the space between table and window.</p>

<p>"The figures whose shadows you saw," said he,
"must have struggled together in this space, so as
to be between the lamp and the blind for the performance
of their pantomime. But I would have
you observe, Mr. Denzil, that there is no disturbance
of the furniture to show that such a struggle
as you describe took place; also that the curtains
are drawn across the window, and no light could
have been thrown on the blind."</p>

<p>"The curtains were, no doubt, drawn after I rang
the bell," said Lucian, glancing towards the heavy
folds of crimson velvet which veiled the window.</p>

<p>"The curtains," retorted Berwin, stripping off
his coat, "were drawn by me before I went out."</p>

<p>Lucian said nothing, but shook his head doubtfully.
Evidently Berwin was trying, for his own
ends, to talk him into a belief that his eyes had
deceived him; but Denzil was too clear-headed a
young man to be so gulled. Berwin's explanations
and excuses only confirmed the idea that there was
something in the man's life which cut him off from
humanity, and which would not bear the light of
day. Hitherto, Lucian had heard rather than seen
Berwin; but now, in the clear light of the lamp,
he had an excellent opportunity of observing both
the man and his quarters.</p>

<p>Berwin was of medium height, and lean, with a
clean-shaven face, hollow cheeks, and black, sunken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>eyes. His hair was grey and thin, his looks wild
and wandering, and the hectic colouring of his face
and narrow chest showed that he was far gone in
consumption. Even as Lucian looked at him he
was shaken by a hollow cough, and when he withdrew
his handkerchief from his lips the white linen
was spotted with blood.</p>

<p>He was in evening dress, and looked eminently
refined, although worn and haggard in appearance.
Denzil noted two peculiar marks about him; the
first, a serpentine cicatrice extending on the right
cheek from lip almost to ear; the second, the loss
of the little finger of the left hand, which was cut
off at the first joint. As he examined the man a
second and more violent fit of coughing shook him.</p>

<p>"You seem to be very ill," said Lucian, pitying
the feebleness of the poor creature.</p>

<p>"Dying of consumption&mdash;one lung gone!"
gasped Berwin. "It will soon be over&mdash;the sooner
the better."</p>

<p>"With your health, Mr. Berwin, it is sheer madness
to dwell in this rigorous English climate."</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied the man, pouring himself
out a tumbler of claret, "but I can't leave England&mdash;I
can't leave this house, even; but on the whole,"
he added, with a satisfied glance around, "I am not
badly lodged."</p>

<p>Lucian agreed with this speech. The room was
furnished in the most luxurious manner. The prevailing
hue was a deep, warm red&mdash;carpet, walls,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>hangings, and furniture were all of this cheerful
tint. The chairs were deep, and softly cushioned;
on the walls were several oil paintings by celebrated
modern artists; there were dwarf bookcases filled
with well-chosen books, and on a small bamboo
table near the fire lay magazines and papers.</p>

<p>The mantelpiece, reaching nearly to the ceiling,
was of oak, framing mirrors of bevelled glass; and
on the numerous shelves, cups, saucers, and vases
of old and valuable china were placed. There was
also a gilt clock, a handsome sideboard, and a neat
smoking-table, on which stood a cut-glass spirit-stand
and a box of cigars. The whole apartment
was furnished with taste and refinement, and Lucian
saw that the man who owned such luxurious
quarters must be possessed of money, as well as
the capability of using it in the most civilised way.</p>

<p>"You have certainly all that the heart of man
can desire in the way of material comforts," said
he, looking at the supper table, which, with its
silver and crystal and spotless covering, glittered
like a jewel under the brilliant lamplight. "My only
wonder is that you should furnish one room so finely
and leave the others bare."</p>

<p>"My bedroom and bathroom are yonder," replied
Berwin, pointing towards large folding doors
draped with velvet curtains, and placed opposite to
the window. "They are as well furnished as this.
But how do you know the rest of this house is
bare?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly help knowing it, Mr. Berwin. Your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>contrast of poverty and riches is an open secret in
this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"No one has been in my house save yourself,
Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have said nothing. You turned me out
so quickly the other night that I had no time for
observation. Besides, I am not in the habit of
remarking on matters which do not concern me."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Berwin weakly. "I
had no intention of offending you. I suppose Mrs.
Kebby has been talking?"</p>

<p>"I should think it probable."</p>

<p>"The skirling Jezebel!" cried Berwin. "I'll pack
her off right away!"</p>

<p>"Are you a Scotchman?" asked Denzil suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" demanded Berwin, without
replying.</p>

<p>"You used an essentially Scotch word&mdash;'skirling.'"</p>

<p>"And I used an essentially American phrase&mdash;'right away,'"
retorted the man. "I may be a
Scot, I may be a Yankee, but I would remind you
that my nationality is my own secret."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to pry into your secrets," said
Denzil, rising from the chair in which he had seated
himself, "and in my turn I would remind you that
I am here at your invitation."</p>

<p>"Don't take offense at a hasty word," said Berwin
nervously. "I am glad of your company, although
I seem rather brusque. You must go over
the house with me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p><p>"I see no necessity to do so."</p>

<p>"It will set your mind at rest regarding the shadows
on the blind."</p>

<p>"I can trust my eyes," said Lucian, drily, "and
I am certain that before I met you a man and a
woman were in this room."</p>

<p>"Well," said Berwin, lighting a small lamp,
"come with me and I'll prove that you are mistaken."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MRS. KEBBY'S DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>The pertinacity which Berwin displayed in insisting
that Lucian should explore the Silent House
was truly remarkable. He appeared to be bent
upon banishing the idea which Denzil entertained
that strangers were hiding in the mansion.</p>

<p>From attic to basement, from front to back premises,
he led the way, and made Lucian examine
every corner of the empty rooms. He showed him
even the unused kitchen, and bade him remark that
the door leading into the yard was locked and bolted,
and, from the rusty condition of the ironwork,
could not have been opened for years. Also, he
made him look out of the window into the yard
itself, with its tall black fence dividing it from
the other properties.</p>

<p>This exploration finished, and Lucian being convinced
that himself and his host were the only two
living beings in the house, Berwin conducted his
half-frozen guest back to the warm sitting-room and
poured out a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"Here, Mr. Denzil," said he in good-natured
tones, "drink this and draw near the fire; you must
be chilled to the bone after our Arctic expedition."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p><p>Lucian willingly accepted both these attentions,
and sipped his wine&mdash;it was particularly fine claret&mdash;before
the fire, while Berwin coughed and shivered,
and muttered to himself about the cold of the
season. When Lucian stood up to take his departure,
he addressed him directly:</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, with a sardonic smile, "are
you convinced that the struggling shadows on yonder
blind were children of your heated fancy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Denzil stoutly, "I am not!"</p>

<p>"Yet you have seen that there is no one in the
house!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Berwin," said Lucian, after a moment's
thought, "you propose a riddle which I cannot answer,
and which I do not wish to answer. I cannot
explain what I saw to-night, but as surely as you
were out of this house, some people were in it.
How this affects you, or what reason you have for
denying it, I do not ask. Keep your own secrets,
and go your own way. I wish you good-night, sir,"
and Lucian moved towards the door.</p>

<p>Berwin, who was holding a full tumbler of rich,
strong port, drank the whole of it in one gulp. The
strong liquor reddened his pallid face and brightened
his sunken eyes; it even strengthened his already
sonorous voice.</p>

<p>"At least you can inform my good neighbours
that I am a peaceful man, desirous of being left to
lead my own life," he said urgently.</p>

<p>"No, sir! I will have nothing to do with your
business. You are a stranger to me, and our ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>quaintance
is too slight to warrant my discussing
your affairs. Besides," added Lucian, with a shrug,
"they do not interest me."</p>

<p>"Yet they may interest the three kingdoms one
day," said Berwin softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, if they deal with danger to society," said
Denzil, thinking his strange neighbour spoke of
anarchistic schemes, "I would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They deal with danger to myself," interrupted
Berwin. "I am a hunted man, and I hide here from
those who wish me ill. I am dying, as you see," he
cried, striking his hollow chest, "but I may not die
quickly enough for those who desire my death."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" cried Lucian, rather startled
by this outburst.</p>

<p>"People with whom you have no concern," replied
the man sullenly.</p>

<p>"That is true enough, Mr. Berwin, so I'll say
good-night!"</p>

<p>"Berwin! Berwin! Ha! ha! A very good name,
Berwin, but not for me. Oh, was there ever so
unhappy a creature as I? False name, false friend,
in disgrace, in hiding! Curse everybody! Go! go!
Mr. Denzil, and leave me to die here like a rat
in its hole!"</p>

<p>"You are ill!" said Lucian, amazed by the man's
fury. "Shall I send a doctor to see you?"</p>

<p>"Send no one," cried Berwin, commanding himself
by a visible effort. "Only go away and leave
me to myself. 'Thou can'st not minister to a mind
diseased.' Go! go!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p><p>"Good-night, then," said Denzil, seeing that
nothing could be done. "I hope you will be better
in the morning."</p>

<p>Berwin shook his head, and with a silent tongue,
which contrasted strangely with his late outcry, ushered
Denzil out of the house.</p>

<p>As the heavy door closed behind him Lucian
descended the steps and looked thoughtfully at the
grim mansion, which was tenanted by so mysterious
a person. He could make nothing of Berwin&mdash;as
he chose to call himself&mdash;he could see no meaning
in his wild words and mad behaviour; but as he
walked briskly back to his lodgings he came to the
conclusion that the man was nothing worse than a
tragic drunkard, haunted by terrors engendered by
over-indulgence in stimulants. The episode of the
shadows on the blind he did not attempt to explain,
for the simple reason that he was unable to find
any plausible explanation to account therefor.</p>

<p>"And why should I trouble my head to do so?"
mused Lucian as he went to bed. "The man and
his mysteries are nothing to me. Bah! I have been
infected by the vulgar curiosity of the Square.
Henceforth I'll neither see nor think of this
drunken lunatic," and with such resolve he dismissed
all thoughts of his strange acquaintance from
his mind, which, under the circumstances, was perhaps
the wisest thing he could do.</p>

<p>But later on certain events took place which
forced him to alter his determination. Fate, with
her own ends to bring about is not to be denied by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>her puppets; and of these Lucian was one, designed
for an important part in the drama which was to be
played.</p>

<p>Mrs. Margery Kebby, who attended to the domestic
economy of Berwin's house, was a deaf old
crone with a constant thirst, only to be assuaged
by strong drink; and a filching hand which was usually
in every pocket save her own. She had neither
kith nor kin, nor friends, nor even acquaintances;
but, being something of a miser, scraped and
screwed to amass money she had no need for, and
dwelt in a wretched little apartment in a back slum,
whence she daily issued to work little and pilfer
much.</p>

<p>Usually at nine o'clock she brought in her employer's
breakfast from the Nelson Hotel, which
was outside the Square, and while he was enjoying
it in bed, after his fashion, she cleaned out and
made tidy the sitting-room. Berwin then dressed
and went out for a walk, despite Miss Greeb's contention
that he took the air only at night, like an
owl, and during his absence Mrs. Kebby attended to
the bedroom. She then went about her own business,
which was connected with the cleaning of various
other apartments, and only returned at midday
and at night to lay the table for Berwin's luncheon
and dinner, or rather dinner and supper, which were
also sent in from the hotel.</p>

<p>For these services Berwin paid her well, and only
enjoined her to keep a quiet tongue about his private
affairs, which Mrs. Kebby usually did until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>excited by too copious drams of gin, when she talked
freely and unwisely to all the servants in the Square.
It was to her observation and invention that Berwin
owed his bad reputation.</p>

<p>Well-known in every kitchen, Mrs. Kebby hobbled
from one to the other, gossiping about the various
affairs of her various employers; and when absolute
knowledge failed she took to inventing details
which did no small credit to her imagination. Also,
she could tell fortunes by reading tea-leaves and
shuffling cards, and was not above aiding the maid
servants in their small love affairs.</p>

<p>In short, Mrs. Kebby was a dangerous old witch,
who, a century back, would have been burnt at the
stake; and the worst possible person for Berwin
to have in his house. Had he known of her lying
and prating she would not have remained an hour
under his roof; but Mrs. Kebby was cunning
enough to steer clear of such a danger in the most
dexterous manner. She had a firm idea that Berwin
had, in her own emphatic phrase, "done something"
for which he was wanted by the police, and
was always on the look out to learn the secret of
his isolated life, in order to betray him, or blackmail
him, or get him in some way under her thumb.
As yet she had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Deeming her a weak, quiet old creature, Berwin,
in spite of his suspicious nature, entrusted Mrs.
Kebby with the key of the front door, so that she
could enter for her morning's work without disturbing
him. The sitting-room door itself was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>always locked, but Berwin usually bolted the portal
of his bedroom, and had invariably to rise and admit
Mrs. Kebby with his breakfast.</p>

<p>The same routine was observed each morning,
and everything went smoothly. Mrs. Kebby had
heard of the blind shadows from several people,
and had poked and pryed about all over the house
in the hope of arriving at some knowledge of the
substantial flesh and blood figures which cast them.
But in this quest, which was intended to put money
into her own pocket, she failed entirely; and during
the whole six months of Berwin's tenancy she
never saw a living soul in No. 13 save her employer;
nor could she ever find any evidence to show that
Berwin had received visitors during her absence.
The man was as great a mystery to Mrs. Kebby
as he was to the square, in spite of her superior
opportunities of learning the truth.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve the old woman brought in
a cold supper for Berwin, as usual, making several
journeys to and fro between hotel and house for
that purpose. She laid the table, made up the fire,
and before taking her leave asked Mr. Berwin if
he wanted anything else.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," replied the man, who looked
wretchedly ill. "You can bring my breakfast to-morrow."</p>

<p>"At nine, sir?"</p>

<p>"At the usual time," answered Berwin impatiently.
"Go away!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kebby gave a final glance round to see that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>all was in order, and shuffled out of the room as fast
as her rheumatism would let her. As she left the
house eight o'clock chimed from the steeple of a
near church, and Mrs. Kebby, clinking her newly-received
wages in her pocket, hurried out of the
square to do her Christmas marketing. As she
went down the street which led to it, Blinders, a
burly, ruddy-faced policeman, who knew her well,
stopped to make an observation.</p>

<p>"Is that good gentleman of yours home, Mrs.
Kebby?" he asked, in the loud tones used to deaf
people.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's home," grumbled Mrs. Kebby ungraciously,
"sittin' afore the fire like Solomon in all
his glory. What d'ye want to know for?"</p>

<p>"I saw him an hour ago," explained Blinders,
"and I thought he looked ill."</p>

<p>"So he do, like a corpse. What of that? We've
all got to come to it some day. 'Ow d'ye know
but what he won't be dead afore morning? Well,
I don't care. He's paid me up till to-night. I'm
going to enj'y myself, I am."</p>

<p>"Don't you get drunk, Mrs. Kebby, or I'll lock
you up."</p>

<p>"Garn!" grunted the old beldame. "Wot's
Christmas Eve for, if it ain't for folk to enj'y theirselves?
Y'are on duty early."</p>

<p>"I'm taking the place of a sick comrade, and
I'll be on duty all night. That's my Christmas."</p>

<p>"Well! well! Let every one enj'y hisself as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>likes," muttered Mrs. Kebby, and shuffled off to the
nearest public house.</p>

<p>Here she began to celebrate the season, and afterwards
went shopping; then she celebrated the
season again, and later carried home her purchases
to the miserable garret she occupied. In this den
Mrs. Kebby, with the aid of gin and water, celebrated
the season until she drank herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning she woke in anything but an amiable
mood, and had to fortify herself with an early
drink before she was fit to go about her business.</p>

<p>It was almost nine when she reached the Nelson
Hotel, and found the covered tray with Mr. Berwin's
breakfast waiting for her; so she hurried with
it to Geneva Square as speedily as possible, fearful
of a scolding. Having admitted herself into the
house, Mrs. Kebby took up the tray with both
hands, and pushed open the sitting-room door with
her foot. Here, at the sight which met her eyes,
she dropped the tray with a crash, and let off a
shrill yell.</p>

<p>The room was in disorder, the table was overturned,
and amid the wreckage of glass and china
lay Mark Berwin, with outspread hands&mdash;stone
dead&mdash;stabbed to the heart.</p>

<h3>THE TALK OF THE TOWN</h3>


<p>Nowadays, events, political, social, and criminal,
crowd so closely on one another's heels that
what was formerly a nine days' wonder is scarcely
marvelled at the same number of minutes. Yet in
certain cases episodes of a mysterious or unexpected
nature engage the attention of a careless world for a
somewhat longer period, and provoke an immense
amount of discussion and surmise. In this category
may be placed the crime committed in Geneva
Square; for when the extraordinary circumstances
of the case became known, much curiosity was manifested
regarding the possible criminal and his motive
for committing so apparently useless a crime.</p>

<p>To add to the wonderment of the public, it came
out in the evidence of Lucian Denzil at the inquest
that Berwin was not the real name of the victim;
so here the authorities were confronted with a three-fold
problem. They had first to discover the name
of the dead man; second, to learn who it was had
so foully murdered him; and third, to find out the
reason why the unknown assassin should have slain
an apparently harmless man.</p>

<p>But these hidden things were not easily brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>to light; and the meagre evidence collected by the
police failed to do away with any one of the three
obstacles&mdash;at all events, until after the inquest.
When the jury brought in a verdict that the deceased
had been violently done to death by some
person or persons unknown, the twelve good men
and true stated the full extent of knowledge gained
by Justice in her futile scramble after clues. Berwin&mdash;so
called&mdash;was dead, his assassin had melted
into thin air, and the Silent House had added a
second legend to its already uncanny reputation.
Formerly it had been simply haunted, now it was
also blood-stained, and its last condition was worse
than its first.</p>

<p>The dead man had been found stabbed to the
heart by some long, thin, sharp-pointed instrument
which the murderer had taken away with him&mdash;or
perhaps her, as the sex of the assassin, for obvious
reasons, could not be decided. Mrs. Kebby swore
that she had left the deceased sitting over the fire
at eight o'clock on Christmas Eve, and that he had
then been fairly well, though far from enjoying
the best of health. When she returned, shortly after
nine, on Christmas morning, the man was dead
and cold. Medical aid was called in at the same
time as the police were summoned; and the evidence
of the doctor who examined the body went
to prove that Berwin had been dead at least ten
hours; therefore, he must have been assassinated between
the hours of eleven and twelve of the previous
night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><p>Search was immediately made for the murderer,
but no trace could be found of him, nor could it be
ascertained how he had entered the house. The
doors were all locked, the windows were all barred,
and neither at the back nor in the front was there
any outlet left open whereby the man&mdash;if it was
a man who had done the deed&mdash;could have escaped.</p>

<p>Blinders, the policeman on duty at the entrance
of the square, gave evidence that he had been on
duty there all night, and that although many servants
and owners of houses belonging to the square
had passed in from their Christmas marketings, yet
no stranger had entered. The policeman knew
every one, even to the errand-boys of the neighbourhood,
who brought parcels of Christmas goods, and
in many cases had exchanged greetings with the
passers-by; but he was prepared to swear, and, in
fact, did swear at the inquest, that no stranger
either came into or went out of Geneva Square.</p>

<p>Also he deposed that when the traffic died away
after midnight he had walked round the square, and
had looked at every window, including that of No.
13, and had tried every door, also including that of
No. 13, only to find that all was safe. Blinders
declared on oath that he had not on Christmas Eve
the slightest suspicion of the horrid tragedy which
had taken place in the Silent House during the time
he was on duty.</p>

<p>When the police took possession of the body and
mansion, search was made in bedroom and sitting-room
for papers likely to throw light on the identity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>of the victim, but in vain. No letters or telegrams,
or even writing of any kind, could be discovered;
there was no name in the dead man's books, no
mark on his clothes, no initials on his linen.</p>

<p>The landlord of the house declared that the deceased
had hired the mansion six months before, but
had given no references, and as the landlord was
glad to let the haunted No. 13 on any terms, he
had not insisted upon having them. The deceased,
said the landlord, had paid a month's rent in advance
in ready money, and at the end of every
month he had discharged his liability in the same
way. He gave neither cheque nor notes, but paid
always in gold; and beyond the fact that he called
himself Mark Berwin, the landlord knew nothing
about him.</p>

<p>The firm who had furnished the rooms made almost
the same report, quite as meagre and unsatisfactory.
Mr. Berwin&mdash;so the deceased had given
his name&mdash;had ordered the furniture, and had paid
for it in gold. Altogether, in spite of every effort,
the police were obliged to declare themselves beaten.
They could not find out the name of the victim, and
therefore were unable to learn his past life, or trace
thereby if he had an enemy likely to harm him.</p>

<p>Beyond the report given by Lucian of his conversation
with the man, which showed that Berwin
certainly had some enemy whom he dreaded, there
was nothing discovered to show reason for the committal
of the crime.</p>

<p>Berwin&mdash;so called&mdash;was dead; he was buried un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>der
his assumed name, and there, so far as the obtainable
evidence went, was an end to the strange
tenant of the Silent House. Gordon Link, the detective
charged with the conduct of the case, confessed
as much to Denzil.</p>

<p>"I do not see the slightest chance of tracing Berwin's
past," said he to the barrister. "We are as
ignorant about him as we are of the name of the
assassin."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there is no clue, Mr. Link?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely none; even the weapon with which
the crime was committed cannot be found."</p>

<p>"You have searched the house?"</p>

<p>"Every inch of it, and with the result that I have
found nothing. The surroundings of the case are
most mysterious. If we do not identify the dead
we cannot hope to trace the murderer. How the
wretch got into the house is more than I can discover."</p>

<p>"It is strange," admitted Lucian thoughtfully,
"yet in some secret way people were in the habit of
entering the house, and Berwin knew as much; not
only that, but he protected them from curiosity by
denying that they even existed."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow you, Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"I allude to the shadows on the blind, which I
saw myself a week before the murder took place.
They were those of a man and a woman, and must
have been cast by bodies of flesh and blood. Therefore,
two people must have been in Berwin's sitting-room
on that night; yet when I met Berwin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> who
was absent at the time&mdash;he denied that anyone
could have entered his house without his knowledge.
More, he actually insisted that I should satisfy
myself as to the truth of this by examining the
house."</p>

<p>"Which you did?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but found nothing; yet," said Lucian, with
an air of conviction, "however the man and woman
entered, they were in the house."</p>

<p>"Then the assassin must have come in by the
same way; but where that way can be, or how it
can be found, is more than I can say."</p>

<p>"Does the landlord know of any secret passages?"</p>

<p>"No; I asked him," replied the detective, "but he
stated that houses nowadays were not built with
secret passages. When Berwin denied that anyone
was in the house, was he afraid, Mr. Denzil?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he seemed to be nervous."</p>

<p>"And he told you he had enemies?"</p>

<p>"He hinted that there were people who wished
to see him dead. From the way he spoke and the
language he used I am satisfied that he was hiding
from the vengeance of some one."</p>

<p>"Vengeance!" repeated Link, raising his eyebrows.
"Is not that word a trifle melodramatic?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but to my mind there is more melodrama
in actual life than people fancy. However,
Mr. Link," added Lucian, "I have come to certain
conclusions. Firstly, that Berwin was in hiding;
secondly, that he saw people secretly who entered in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>some way we cannot discover; and thirdly, that to
solve the problem it will be necessary to look into
the past life of the dead man."</p>

<p>"Your third conclusion brings us round to the
point whence we started," retorted Link. "How
am I to discover the man's past?"</p>

<p>"By learning who he is, and what is his real
name."</p>

<p>"An easy task," said the detective sarcastically,
"considering the meagre material upon which we
have to work. And how is the business to be accomplished?"</p>

<p>"By advertisement."</p>

<p>"Advertisement!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I wonder the idea did not strike you before,
seeing how often it is used in similar cases.
Advertise a full description of the man who called
himself Berwin, note his physical peculiarities and
looks, and circulate such description by means of
handbills and newspapers."</p>

<p>Link looked angry, and laughed rather contemptuously,
as his professional pride was touched by the
fact of being advised by an individual not of his
calling.</p>

<p>"I am not so ignorant of my business as you
think," he said sharply. "What you suggest has
already been done. There are handbills describing
the appearance of Berwin in every police office in
the kingdom."</p>

<p>"In the newspapers, also?" asked Lucian, nettled
by the detective's tone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p><p>"No; it is not necessary."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you. Many people in private
life are not likely to see your handbills. I don't
pretend to advise, Mr. Link," he added in soothing
tones, "but would it not be wise to use the medium
of the daily papers?"</p>

<p>"I'll think of it," said Link, too jealous of his
dignity to give way at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, I quite rely on your discretion," said Denzil
hastily. "You know your own business best. But
if you succeed in identifying Berwin, will you let
me know?"</p>

<p>Link looked keenly at the young man.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to know about the matter?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Out of simple curiosity. The case is so mysterious
that I should like to watch you unravel it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Link, rather gratified by this tribute
to his power, "I shall indulge your fancy."</p>

<p>The result of this conversation was that Lucian
observed in the newspapers next day an advertisement
describing the looks and name, and physical
peculiarities of the deceased, with special mention
of the loss of the left hand's little finger, and the
strange cicatrice on the right cheek. Satisfied that
the only way to learn the truth had been adopted
by the authorities, Lucian impatiently waited for
the development of the scheme.</p>

<p>Within the week he received a visit from the detective.</p>

<p>"You were right and I was wrong, Mr. Denzil,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>admitted Link generously. "The newspapers were
of more use than the handbills. Yesterday I received
a letter from a lady who is coming to see
me to-morrow at my office. So if you care to be
present at the interview you have only to say so."</p>

<p>"I should like it above all things," said Lucian
eagerly. "Who is the lady?"</p>

<p>"A Mrs. Vrain, who writes from Bath."</p>

<p>"Can she identify the dead man?"</p>

<p>"She thinks she can, but, of course, she cannot
be certain until she sees the body. Going by the
description, however," added Link, "she is inclined
to believe that Berwin was her husband."</p>

<h3>MRS. VRAIN'S STORY</h3>


<p>Denzil was much pleased with the courtesy of
the detective Link in permitting him to gain, at
first hand, further details of this mysterious case.
With a natural curiosity, engendered by his short
acquaintance with the unfortunate Berwin, he was
most anxious to learn why the man had secluded
himself from the world in Geneva Square; who
were the enemies he hinted at as desirous of his
death; and in what manner and for what reason he
had met with so barbarous a fate at their hands. It
seemed likely that Mrs. Vrain, who asserted herself
to be the wife of the deceased, would be able
to answer these questions in full; therefore, he was
punctual in keeping the appointment at the office
of Link.</p>

<p>He was rather astonished to find that Mrs. Vrain
had arrived, and was deep in conversation with the
detective, while a third person, who had evidently
accompanied her, sat near at hand, silent, but attentive
to what was being discussed. As the dead
man had been close on sixty years of age, and Mrs.
Vrain claimed to be his wife, Denzil had quite ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>pected
to meet with an elderly woman. Instead of
doing so, however, he beheld a pretty young lady
of not more than twenty-five, whose raiment of widow's
weeds set off her beauty to the greatest advantage.
She was a charming blonde, with golden
hair and blue eyes, and a complexion of rose-leaf
hue. In spite of her grief her demeanour was lively
and engaging, and her smile particularly attractive,
lighting up her whole face in the most fascinating
manner. Her hands and feet were small, her stature
was that of a fairy, and her figure was perfect in
every way.</p>

<p>Altogether, Mrs. Vrain looked like a sylph or a
dainty shepherdess of Dresden china, and should
have been arrayed in gossamer robes, rather than in
the deep mourning she affected. Indeed, Lucian
considered that such weeds were rather premature,
as Mrs. Vrain could not yet be certain that the
murdered man was her husband; but she looked so
charming and childlike a creature that he forgave
her being too eager to consider herself a widow.
Perhaps with such an elderly husband her eagerness
was natural.</p>

<p>From this charming vision Lucian's eyes wandered
to the attentive third person, a rosy-cheeked,
plump little man, of between fifty and sixty. From
his resemblance to Mrs. Vrain&mdash;for he had the
same blue eyes and pink-and-white complexion&mdash;Lucian
guessed that he was her father, and such,
indeed, proved to be the case. Link, on Lucian's
entrance, introduced him to the sylph in black, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>in her turn presented him to the silvery-haired, benevolent
old man, whom she called Mr. Jabez
Clyne.</p>

<p>At the first sound of their voices Lucian detected
so pronounced a twang, and so curious a way of
collocating words, as to conclude that Mrs. Vrain
and her amiable parent hailed from the States. The
little lady seemed to pride herself on this, and indicated
her republican origin in her speech more than
was necessary&mdash;at least, Denzil thought so. But
then, on occasions, he was disposed to be hyper-critical.</p>

<p>"Say, now," said Mrs. Vrain, casting an approving
glance on Lucian's face, "I'm right down
glad to see you. Mr. Link here was just saying you
knew my husband, Mr. Vrain."</p>

<p>"I knew him as Mr. Berwin&mdash;Mark Berwin,"
replied Denzil, taking a seat.</p>

<p>"Just think of that now!" cried Mrs. Vrain,
with a liveliness rather subdued in compliment to
her apparel; "and his real name was Mark Vrain.
Well, I guess he won't need no name now, poor
man," and the widow touched her bright eyes carefully
with a doll's pocket-handkerchief, which Lucian
noted, somewhat cynically, was perfectly dry.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's an angel by this time, Lyddy," said
Mr. Clyne, in a cheerful, chirping voice, "so it ain't
no use wishing him back, as I can see. We've all
got to negotiate kingdom-come some time or another."</p>

<p>"Not in the same way, I hope," said Lucian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>dryly. "But I beg your pardon, Link, I interrupt
your conversation."</p>

<p>"By no means," replied the detective readily.
"We had just begun when you entered, Mr.
Denzil."</p>

<p>"And it wasn't much of a talk, anyhow," said
Mrs. Vrain. "I was only replying to some stupid
questions."</p>

<p>"Stupid, if you will, but necessary," observed
Link, with gravity. "Let us continue. Are you
certain that this dead man is&mdash;or rather was&mdash;your
husband?"</p>

<p>"I'm as sure as sure can be, sir. Berwin Manor
is the name of our place near Bath, and it looks
as though my husband called himself after it when
he changed his colours. And isn't his first name
Mark?" pursued the pretty widow. "Well, my
husband was called Mark, too, so there you are&mdash;Mark
Berwin."</p>

<p>"Is this all your proof?" asked Link calmly.</p>

<p>"I guess not, though it's enough, I should say.
My husband had a mark on his right cheek&mdash;got it
fighting a duel with a German student when he
was having a high time as one of the boys at Heidelberg.
Then he lost part of his little finger&mdash;left-hand
finger&mdash;in an accident out West. What other
proof do you want, Mr. Link?"</p>

<p>"The proofs you have given seem sufficient, Mrs.
Vrain, but may I ask when your husband left his
home?"</p>

<p>"About a year ago, eh, poppa?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p><p>"You are overdoing it, Lyddy," corrected the
father. "Size it up as ten months, and you'll do."</p>

<p>"Ten months," said Lucian suddenly, "and Mr.
Berwin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vrain!" struck in Lydia, the widow, "Mark
Vrain."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon! Well, Mark Vrain took
the house in Geneva Square six months back. Where
was he during the other four?"</p>

<p>"Ask me something easier, Mr. Denzil. I know
no more than you do."</p>

<p>"Did you not know where he went on leaving
Berwin Manor?"</p>

<p>"Sakes! how should I? Mark and I didn't pull
together nohow, so he kicked over the traces and
made tracks for the back of beyond."</p>

<p>"And you might square it, Lyddy, by saying as
'twasn't you who upset the apple cart."</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile to think so," said Mrs.
Vrain vigorously. "I was as good as pie to that
old man."</p>

<p>"You did not get on well together?" said Link
sharply.</p>

<p>"Got on as well as a cat hitched along with a dog.
My stars! there was no living with him. If he
hadn't left me, I'd have left him&mdash;that's an almighty
truth."</p>

<p>"So the gist of all this is that Mr. Vrain left
you ten months ago, and did not leave his address?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said the widow calmly. "I've not
seen nor heard of him for most a year, till pop there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>tumbled across your paragraph in the papers. Then
I surmised from the name and the missing finger
and the scarred cheek, that I'd dropped right on
to Mark. I wouldn't take all this trouble for any
one else; no, sir, not me!"</p>

<p>"My Lyddy does not care about being a grass-widow,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I don't mind being a grass-widow or a real one,
so long as I know how to ticket myself," said the
candid Lydia; "but seems to me there's no question
that Mark's sent in his checks."</p>

<p>"I certainly think that this man who called himself
Berwin was your husband," said Denzil, for
Mrs. Vrain's eyes rested on him, and she seemed
to expect an answer.</p>

<p>"Well, then, that means I'm Mr. Vrain's
widow?"</p>

<p>"I should say so."</p>

<p>"And entitled to all his pile?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the will," said Lucian dryly,
for the light tone of the pretty woman jarred upon
his ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," replied Mrs. Vrain, putting
a gold-topped smelling bottle to her nose. "I
saw the will made, and know exactly how I come
out. The old man's daughter by his first wife gets
the manor and the rents, and I take the assurance
money!"</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Berwin&mdash;I beg pardon, Vrain&mdash;was
he married twice?"</p>

<p>"I should think so!" said Lydia. "He was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>widower with a grown-up daughter when I took
him to church. Well, can I get this assurance
money?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Link, "provided you can
prove your husband's death."</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" cried Mrs. Vrain briskly. "Wasn't
he murdered?"</p>

<p>"The man called Berwin was murdered."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the rosy-cheeked Clyne, with
more sharpness than might have been expected from
his peaceful aspect, "and ain't Berwin Vrain?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so," replied Link coolly. "All
your evidence goes to prove it, yet the assurance
company may not be satisfied with the proof. I
expect the grave will have to be opened, and the
remains identified."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Mrs. Vrain with a shrug, "how disgusting!
I mean," she added, colouring as she saw
that Lucian was rather shocked by her flippancy,
"that sorry as I am for the old man, he wasn't a
good husband to me, and corpses a week old ain't
pleasant things to look on."</p>

<p>"Lyddy," interposed Clyne, hastening to obliterate,
if possible, the impression made on the two men
by this foolish speech, "how you do go on. But
you know your heart is better than your tongue."</p>

<p>"It was, to put up so long with Mr. Vrain," said
Lydia resentfully; "but I'm honest, if I'm nothing
else. I guess I'm sorry that Vrain got stuck like
a pig; but it wasn't my fault, and I've done my
best to show respect by wearing black. But it is no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>good going on in this way, poppa, for I've no call
to excuse myself to strangers. What I want to
know is how I'm going to get the dollars."</p>

<p>"You'll have to see the assurance company about
that," said Link coldly; "my business with you,
Mrs. Vrain, is about this murder."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," retorted the widow.
"I haven't set eyes on Mark for most a year."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who killed him?"</p>

<p>"I guess not! How should I?"</p>

<p>"You might know if he had enemies."</p>

<p>"He," said Mrs. Vrain, with supreme contempt,
"why, he hadn't backbone enough for folks to get
riz at him! He was half baked!"</p>

<p>"Crazy, that is," remarked Clyne; "always
thought the world was against him, and folks wanted
to get quit of him."</p>

<p>"He said he had enemies," hinted Lucian.</p>

<p>"You bet! He no doubt made out that all Europe
was against him," said Clyne. "That was my
son-in-law all over. Lyddy and he had a tiff, just
like other married couples, and he clears out to lie
low in an out-of-the-way shanty in Pimlico. I tell
you, gentlemen, that Vrain had a chip out of his
head. He fancied things, he did; but no one wanted
to harm him that I know of."</p>

<p>"Yet he died a violent death," said Denzil
gravely.</p>

<p>"That's a frozen fact, sir," cried Clyne, "and
both Lyddy and I want to lynch the reptile as did
it; but we neither of us know who laid him out."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p><p>"I'm sure I don't," said Mrs. Vrain in a weeping
voice. "Every one that I knew was civil to him;
he had no one who wanted to kill him when he
left Berwin Manor. Why he went away, or how he
died, I can't say."</p>

<p>"If you want to know how he died," explained
Link, "I can tell you. He was stabbed."</p>

<p>"So the journals said; with a bowie!"</p>

<p>"No, not with a bowie," corrected Lucian, "but
with some long, sharp instrument."</p>

<p>"A dagger?" suggested Clyne.</p>

<p>"I should be even more precise," said Denzil
slowly. "I should say a stiletto&mdash;an Italian stiletto."</p>

<p>"A stiletto!" gasped Mrs. Vrain, whose delicate
pink colour had faded to a chalky white. "Oh!&mdash;oh!
I&mdash;I&mdash;" and she fainted forthwith.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE ASSURANCE MONEY</h3>


<p>Mrs. Vrain's fainting fit was of no great duration,
and she shortly recovered her senses, but not
her sprightliness. Her excuse was that the long
discussion of her husband's murder, and the too
precise details related to her by Link before Denzil's
arrival, had so wrought on her nerves as to
occasion her temporary indisposition.</p>

<p>This reason, which was a trifle weak, since she
seemed to bear her husband's loss with great stoicism,
awakened suspicions in Lucian's mind as to her
truthfulness. However, these were too vague and
confused to be put into words, so the young man
remained silent until Mrs. Vrain and her father
departed. This they did almost immediately, after
the widow had given her London and country addresses
to the detective, in case he should require
her in the conduct of the case.</p>

<p>This matter being attended to, she left the room,
with a parting smile and especial bow to Lucian.</p>

<p>Link smiled in his turn as he observed this Parthian
shaft, the shooting of which was certainly
out of keeping with Mrs. Vrain's character of a
mourning widow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p><p>"You seem to have made an impression on the
lady, Mr. Denzil," he said, with a slight cough to
conceal his amusement.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied Lucian, his fair face crimsoning
with vexation. "She seems to me one of
those shallow women who would sooner flirt with a
tinker than pass unnoticed by the male sex. I don't
like her," he concluded, with some abruptness.</p>

<p>"On what grounds?"</p>

<p>"Well, she spoke very hardly about her husband,
and seemed rather more concerned about this
assurance money than his death. She is a flippant
doll, with a good deal of the adventuress about
her. I don't think," said the barrister significantly,
"that she is altogether so ignorant of this matter
as she pretends to be."</p>

<p>The detective raised his eyebrows. "You don't
propose to accuse her of the murder?" he asked
sceptically.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" answered Denzil hastily. "I don't
say she is as guilty as all that; but she knows something,
or suspects something."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"She fainted at the mention of stiletto; and I
am convinced that Vrain&mdash;as I suppose we must
call him now&mdash;was killed with one. And again,
Link, this woman admitted that she had married
her elderly husband in Florence. Now, Florence,
as you know, is an Italian town; a stiletto is an
Italian weapon. Putting these two things together,
what do you make of Mrs. Vrain's fainting?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p><p>"I make nothing of it, Mr. Denzil. You are
too suspicious. The woman had no reason to rid
herself of her husband as you hint."</p>

<p>"What about the assurance money?"</p>

<p>"There is a motive there, certainly&mdash;a motive
of gain. Still, I think you are making a mountain
out of a molehill, for I am satisfied that she knows
no more who committed the crime than does the
Pope himself."</p>

<p>"It is as well to look in every direction," said
Lucian obstinately.</p>

<p>"Meaning that I should follow this clue you
suggest, which has no existence save in your own
fancy. Well, I'll keep my eye on Mrs. Vrain, you
may be sure of that. It won't be difficult, as she
will certainly stay in town until she identifies the
body of her dead husband and gets the money. If
she is guilty, I'll track her down; but I am certain
she has nothing to do with the crime. If she had,
it is not likely that she would enter the lion's den
by coming to see me. No, no, Mr. Denzil; you
have found a mare's nest."</p>

<p>Lucian shrugged his shoulders, and took up his
hat to go.</p>

<p>"You may be right," said he reluctantly, "but I
have my doubts of Mrs. Vrain, and shall continue
to have them until she supplies a more feasible explanation
of her fainting. In the meantime, I'll
leave you to follow out the case in the manner you
judge best. We shall see who is right in the long
run," and Denzil, still holding to his opinion, took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>his departure, leaving Link confident that the young
man did not know what he was talking about.</p>

<p>As the detective sat thinking over the late conversation,
and wondering if he could shape any
definite course out of it, Denzil put his head in at
the door.</p>

<p>"I say, Link," he called out, "you'd better find
out if Mrs. Vrain is really the wife of this dead
man before you are guided by her story!" After
which speech he hurriedly withdrew, leaving Link
to digest it at his leisure.</p>

<p>At first, Link was indignant that Denzil should
deem him so easily hoodwinked as the speech implied.
Afterwards he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Wife!" said he to himself. "Of course she is
the man's wife! She knows too much about him
to be otherwise; but even granting that Denzil is
right&mdash;which I don't for a moment admit&mdash;there is
no need for me to prove the truth of his assumption.
If this pretty woman is not the true wife of Berwin,
or Vrain, or whatever this dead man's name
actually may be, the assurance company will get
at the rights of the matter before paying over the
money."</p>

<p>Subsequent events reflected credit on this philosophical
speech and determination of Mr. Link.
Had Mrs. Vrain been an imposter, her house of
cards would have been knocked down, as soon as
reared, by the searching inquiry instituted by the
Sirius Assurance Company. It appeared that the
life of the late Mark Vrain was on the books of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>the company for no less a sum than twenty thousand
pounds; and under the will this was to be paid
over to Lydia Vrain, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clyne. The widow, aided
by her father&mdash;who was a shrewd business man, in
spite of his innocent looks&mdash;and the family lawyer
of the Vrains, went systematically to work to establish
her own identity, the death of her husband,
and her consequent right to the money.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to prove that the
dead man was really Vrain. There was some little
difficulty in obtaining an order from the authorities
for the opening of the grave and the exhumation of
the body; but finally the consent of those in power
was obtained, and there was little difficulty in the
identification of the remains. The lawyer, Mr.
Clyne, Mrs. Vrain herself, and several people
brought up from Bath by the assurance company,
swore that the corpse&mdash;buried under the false name
of Berwin&mdash;was that of Mark Vrain, for decomposition
had not proceeded so far but what the
features could be recognised. There was even no
need to unwrap the body from its cerements, as
the face itself, and the scar thereon, were quite
sufficient for the friends of the deceased to swear
to the corpse. Thereupon the assurance company,
on the fullest of evidence, was compelled to admit
that their client was dead, and expressed themselves
ready to pay over the money to Mrs. Vrain as soon
as the will should be proved.</p>

<p>Pending the legal process necessary to do this,
the widow made a great parade of her grief and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>affection for the dead man. She had the body re-enclosed
in a new and sumptuous coffin, and removed
the same to Berwin Manor, near Bath,
where, after a short lapse of time, it was duly placed
in the family vault of the Vrains.</p>

<p>The widow, having thus disposed of her husband,
bethought herself of her stepdaughter, who
at that time was on a visit to some friends in Australia.
A long letter, giving full details, was despatched
by Mrs. Vrain, and the daughter was requested,
both by the widow and the lawyer, to come
back to England at once and take up her abode in
Berwin Manor, which, with its surrounding acres,
had been left to her under the will.</p>

<p>Matters connected with the death and its consequences
having been disposed of thus far, Mrs.
Vrain sat down, and, folding her hands, waited till
such time as she would receive the assurance money,
and begin a new life as a wealthy and fascinating
widow. Every one said that the little woman had
behaved very well, and that Vrain&mdash;weak-headed
as he was supposed to be&mdash;had shown excellent
judgment in dividing his property, real and personal,
so equally between the two claimants. Miss
Vrain, as became the child of the first wife, received
the home and acres of her ancestors; while
the second wife obtained the assurance money,
which every one candidly admitted she quite deserved
for having sacrificed her youth and beauty to
an old man like Vrain. In those days, when all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>these details were being settled, the widow was the
most popular personage in Bath.</p>

<p>Matters went smoothly with Mrs. Vrain in every
respect. The will was duly proved, the twenty
thousand pounds was duly paid over; so, finding
herself rich, the widow came with her father to
take up her abode in London. When settled there
one of her first acts was to send a note to Lucian,
telling him that she was in town. The good looks
of the young man had made a considerable impression
on Mrs. Vrain, and she appeared anxious to
renew the acquaintance, although it had been so
inauspiciously begun in the purlieus of the police
courts.</p>

<p>On his part, Lucian lost no time in paying his respects,
for after the searching inquiry conducted
by the Sirius Assurance Company, out of which
ordeal Mrs. Vrain had emerged unscathed, he began
to think that he had been too hasty in condemning
the little widow. So he called upon her
almost immediately after receiving the invitation,
and found her, after the lapse of three months,
as pretty as ever, and clothed in less heavy mourning.</p>

<p>"It's real sweet of you to call, Mr. Denzil," said
she vivaciously. "I haven't seen anything of you
since we met in Mr. Link's office. And sakes! have
I not had a heap of trouble since then?"</p>

<p>"Your trouble has done you no harm, Mrs.
Vrain. So far as your looks go, three minutes,
rather than three months, might have passed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p><p>"Oh, that's all right. I guess it's not good enough
to cry one's self sick for what can't be helped. But
I want to ask you, Mr. Denzil, how that policeman
is progressing with the case."</p>

<p>"He has found out nothing," replied Lucian,
shaking his head, "and, so far as I can see, there's
not much chance of learning the truth."</p>

<p>"I never thought there was," said Mrs. Vrain,
with a shrug. "Seems to me you don't get round
much in this old country. Well, it don't seem as
I can do much more. I've told all I know, and I've
offered a reward of &pound;500 to discover the man who
stuck Mark. If he ain't found for dollars he won't
be found at all."</p>

<p>"Probably not, Mrs. Vrain. It is now over three
months since the crime was committed, and every
day makes the chance of discovery less."</p>

<p>"But for all that, Diana Vrain's going on the
trail, Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"Diana Vrain! Who is she?"</p>

<p>"My stepdaughter&mdash;Mark's only child. She was
in Australia&mdash;out in the wild west of that country&mdash;and
only lately got the news of her father's
death. I got a letter from her last week, and it
seems as she's coming back here to find out who laid
her poppa out."</p>

<p>"I am afraid she'll not succeed," said Denzil dubiously.</p>

<p>"She'll do her best to," replied Mrs. Vrain, with
a shrug. "She's as obstinate as a battery mule;
but it's no use talking, she will have her own way,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>and dismissing the subject of Miss Vrain, the pretty
widow, with an air of relief, talked on more frivolous
subjects until Lucian took his departure.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>DIANA VRAIN</h3>


<p>Although over three months had elapsed since
the murder of Mark Vrain, and the crime had been
relegated to oblivion both by press and people, curiosity
concerning it was still active in Geneva
Square. The gossips in that talkative quarter had
exhausted their tongues and imaginations in surmising
who had committed the deed, and how it
had been accomplished.</p>

<p>It was now known that the deceased had been
of a good county family, who had left his pretty
young wife in a fit of groundless suspicion; that he
had no enemies; and had withdrawn to the Silent
House to save himself from the machinations of
purely imaginary beings. The general opinion was
that Vrain had been insane; but even this did not
explain the reason of his tragic and unforeseen
death.</p>

<p>Since the murder the Silent House had acquired
a tenfold interest in the eyes of all. The crime,
added to its reputation for being haunted, invested
it with horror; and its commonplace looks assumed
to fanciful onlookers a grim and menacing aspect,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>in keeping with its blood-stained floor and ghostly
rooms.</p>

<p>Disheartened by the late catastrophe, which had
so greatly enhanced the already evil reputation of
the house, the landlord did not attempt to relet it,
as he knew very well that no tenant would be bold
enough to take it, even at a nominal rent. Mrs.
Vrain had sold off the furniture of the two apartments
which her unfortunate husband had inhabited,
and now these were as bare and lonely as the
rest of the rooms.</p>

<p>The landlord made no effort to furbish up or
renovate the mansion, deeming that such expense
would be useless; so No. 13, deserted by man, and
cursed by God, remained vacant and avoided. People
came from far and near to look at it, but no
one entered its doors lest some evil fate should befall
them. Yet, in strange contradiction to the horror
it created in every breast, the houses on either
side continued to be occupied.</p>

<p>Miss Greeb frequently took a peep across the
way at the empty house, with its curtainless, dusty
windows and smokeless chimneys. She had theorised
often on the murder of Vrain, and being unable
to come to any reasonable conclusion, finally decided
that a ghost&mdash;the ghost which haunted the mansion&mdash;had
committed the crime. In support of this
fantastic opinion she related to Lucian at least a
score of stories in which people foolishly sleeping
in haunted rooms had been found dead in the morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p><p>"With black finger-marks on their throats," said
Miss Greeb dramatically, "and looks of horror in
their eyes, and everything locked up, just like it
was in No. 13, to show that nothing but a ghost
could have killed them."</p>

<p>"You forget, Miss Greeb," said Lucian flippantly,
"poor Vrain was stabbed with a stiletto. Ghosts
don't use material weapons."</p>

<p>"How do you know the dagger was a real one?"
replied Miss Greeb, sinking her voice to a horrified
whisper. "Was it ever seen? No! Was it ever
found? No! The ghost took it away. Depend
upon it, Mr. Denzil, it wasn't flesh and blood as
made a spirit of that crazy Berwin."</p>

<p>"In that case, the ghostly criminal can't be
hanged," said Denzil, with a laugh. "But it's all
nonsense, Miss Greeb. I am astonished that a
woman of your sense should believe in such rubbish."</p>

<p>"Wiser people than I have faith in ghosts," retorted
the landlady obstinately. "Haven't you
heard of the haunted house in a West End square,
where a man and a dog were found dead in the
morning, with a valet as gibbered awful ever afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Pooh! That's a story of Bulwer Lytton's."</p>

<p>"It is not, Mr. Denzil&mdash;it's a fact. You can
see the very house in the square for yourself, and
No. 13 is just such another."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Why, I'd sleep in No. 13 to-mor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>row
night, just to prove that your ghostly fears are
all moonshine."</p>

<p>Miss Greeb uttered a screech of alarm. "Mr.
Denzil!" she cried, with great energy, "sooner than
you should do that, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;well, I don't know
what I'd do!"</p>

<p>"Accuse me of stealing your silver spoons and
have me locked up," said Lucian, laughing. "Make
yourself easy, Miss Greeb. I have no intention of
tempting Providence. All the same, I don't believe
for one minute that No. 13 is haunted."</p>

<p>"Lights were seen flitting from room to room."</p>

<p>"No doubt. Poor Vrain showed me over the
house before he died. His candle explains the
lights."</p>

<p>"They have been seen since his death," said Miss
Greeb solemnly.</p>

<p>"Then, as a ghost, Vrain must be walking about
with the old woman phantom who wears brocade
and high-heeled shoes."</p>

<p>Miss Greeb, seeing that she had a sceptic to deal
with, retreated with great dignity from the argument,
but nevertheless to other people maintained
her opinion, with many facts drawn from her imagination
and from books on the supernatural compiled
from the imagination&mdash;or, as the various writers
called it&mdash;the experience of others. Some agreed
with her, others laughed at her; but one and all
acknowledged that, however it came about, whether
by ghostly or mortal means, the murder of Vrain
was a riddle never likely to be solved; and, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>other events of a like nature and mystery, it was
relegated to the list of undiscovered crimes.</p>

<p>After several interviews with Link, the barrister
was also inclined to take this view of the matter.
He found the detective quite discouraged in his
efforts to find the assassin.</p>

<p>"I have been to Bath," said Link dismally. "I
have examined, so far as I was able, into the past
life of Vrain, but I can find nothing likely to throw
light on the subject. He did not get on well with
his wife, and left Bath ten months before the murder.
I tried to trace where he went to, but could
not. He vanished from Bath quite unexpectedly,
and four months later turned up in Geneva Square,
as we know, but who killed him, or why he was
killed, I can't say. I'm afraid I'll have to give it
up as a bad job, Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"What! and lose a reward of five hundred
pounds!" said Lucian.</p>

<p>"If it was five thousand, I must lose it," returned
the dejected Link. "This case beats me. I don't
believe the murderer will ever be run down."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I am inclined to agree with
you," said Denzil, and barrister and detective departed,
each convinced that the Vrain case was
ended, and that in the face of the insuperable obstacles
presented by it there was not the slightest
chance of avenging the murder of the unfortunate
man. The reading of the mystery was beyond mortal
powers to accomplish.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p><p>About the middle of April, nearly four months
after the tragedy, Lucian received a letter containing
an invitation which caused him no little astonishment.
The note was signed Diana Vrain, and,
having intimated that the writer had returned only
that week from Australia, requested that Mr. Denzil
would be kind enough to call the next day at the
Royal John Hotel in Kensington. Miss Vrain ended
by stating that she had a particular desire to
converse with Mr. Denzil, and hoped that he would
not fail to keep the appointment.</p>

<p>Wondering greatly how the lady&mdash;who was no
doubt the stepdaughter referred to by Mrs. Vrain&mdash;had
obtained his address, and why she desired
to see him so particularly, Lucian, out of sheer curiosity,
obeyed the summons. Next day, at four
o'clock&mdash;the appointed hour&mdash;he presented himself
as requested, and, on giving his name, was shown
immediately into the presence of his correspondent,
who occupied a small private sitting-room.</p>

<p>When Miss Vrain rose to greet him, Lucian was
amazed to see how beautiful and stately she was.
With dark hair and eyes, oval face, and firm mouth,
majestic figure and imperial gait, she moved towards
him an apparent queen. A greater contrast
to Mrs. Vrain than her stepdaughter can scarcely
be imagined: the one was a frivolous, volatile fairy,
the other a dignified and reserved woman. She
also was arrayed in black garments, but these were
made in the plainest manner, and showed none of
the coquetry of woe such as had characterised Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Vrain's elaborate costume. The look of sorrow
on the face of Diana was in keeping with her
mourning apparel, and she welcomed Lucian with
a subdued courtesy which prepossessed him greatly
in her favour.</p>

<p>Quick in his likes and dislikes, the young man
was as drawn towards this beautiful, sad woman as
formerly he had been repulsed by the feigned grief
and ensnaring glances of silly Mrs. Vrain.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you for calling, Mr. Denzil,"
said Miss Vrain in a deep voice, rather melancholy
in its tone. "No doubt you wondered how
I obtained your address."</p>

<p>"It did strike me as peculiar, I confess," said
Lucian, taking a chair to which she pointed, "but
on considering the matter I fancied that Mrs. Vrain
had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vrain!" echoed Diana in a tone of contempt.
"No! I have not seen Mrs. Vrain since
I returned, a week ago, to London. I got your
address from the detective who examined into the
death of my most unhappy father."</p>

<p>"You have seen Link?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I know all that Link could tell me.
He mentioned your name frequently in his narrative,
and gave me to understand that on two occasions
you had spoken with my father; therefore,
I asked him to give me your address, so that I might
speak with you personally on the matter."</p>

<p>"I am quite at your service, Miss Vrain. I sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>pose
you wish to learn all that I know of the tragedy?"</p>

<p>"I wish for more than that, Mr. Denzil," said
Diana quietly. "I wish you to help me in hunting
down the assassin of my father."</p>

<p>"What! Do you intend to reopen the case?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but I did not know that the case&mdash;as
you call it&mdash;had been closed. I have come home
from Australia especially to devote myself to this
matter. I should have been in London long ago,
but that out in Australia I was with some friends
in a part of the country where it is difficult to get
letters. As soon as Mrs. Vrain's letter about the
terrible end of my father came to hand I arranged
my affairs and left at once for England. Since my
arrival I have seen Mr. Saker, our family lawyer,
and Mr. Link, the detective. They have told me
all they know, and now I wish to hear what you
have to say."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot help you, Miss Vrain,"
said Lucian dubiously.</p>

<p>"Ah! You refuse to help me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! I shall only be too glad to do
what I can," protested Lucian, shocked that she
should think him so hard-hearted, "but I know of
nothing likely to solve the mystery. Both myself
and Link have done our best to discover the truth,
but without success."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Denzil," said Diana, after a pause,
"they often say that a woman's wit can do more
than a man's logic, so you and I must put our heads
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>together and discover the guilty person. Have you
no suspicion?"</p>

<p>"No. I have no suspicion," replied Lucian
frankly. "Have you?"</p>

<p>"I have. I suspect&mdash;a lady."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How do you know I meant her?"</p>

<p>"Because at one time I suspected her myself."</p>

<p>"You suspected rightly," replied Diana. "I believe
that Mrs. Vrain killed her husband."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A MARRIAGE THAT WAS A FAILURE</h3>


<p>Denzil did not reply at once to the accusation
levelled by Diana at Mrs. Vrain, as he was too
astonished at her vehemence to find his voice readily.
When he did speak, it was to argue on the
side of the pretty widow.</p>

<p>"I think you must be mistaken," he said at
length.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Denzil, you declared that you suspected
her yourself!"</p>

<p>"At one time, but not now," replied Lucian decisively,
"because at the time of the murder Mrs.
Vrain was keeping Christmas in Berwin Manor."</p>

<p>"Like Nero fiddling when Rome was burning,"
retorted Diana sharply; "but you mistake my meaning.
I do not say that Mrs. Vrain committed the
crime personally, but she inspired and guided the
assassin."</p>

<p>"And who is the assassin, in your opinion?"</p>

<p>"Count Hercule Ferruci."</p>

<p>"An Italian?"</p>

<p>"As you may guess from the name."</p>

<p>"Now, that is strange," cried Lucian, with some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>excitement, "for, from the nature of the wound,
I believe that your father was stabbed by an Italian
stiletto."</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Diana, with satisfaction. "That
strengthens the accusation I bring against Ferruci."</p>

<p>"And, again," continued Denzil, hardly listening
to what she was saying, "when I mentioned my
suspicion about the stiletto in the hearing of Mrs.
Vrain, she fainted."</p>

<p>"Which showed that her guilty conscience
pricked her. Oh, I am sure of it, Mr. Denzil! My
stepmother and the count are the criminals!"</p>

<p>"Our evidence, as yet, is only circumstantial,"
said Lucian cautiously. "We must not jump to
conclusions. At present I am completely in the
dark regarding this foreigner."</p>

<p>"I can enlighten you, but it is a long story."</p>

<p>"The longer the better," said Denzil, thinking
he could hear Diana speak and watch her face for
hours without weariness. "I wish for all details,
then I shall be in a better position to judge."</p>

<p>"What you say is only reasonable, Mr. Denzil.
I shall tell you my father's history from the time
he went to Italy some three years ago. It was in
Italy&mdash;to be precise, in Florence&mdash;that he met with
Lydia Clyne and her father."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Denzil. "Before you begin,
will you tell me what you think of the couple?"</p>

<p>"Think!" cried Diana disdainfully. "I think
they are a couple of adventurers; but she is the
worst of the two. The old man, Jabez Clyne, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>think moderately well of; he is a weak fool under
the thumb of his daughter. If you only knew what
I have suffered at the hands of that golden-haired
doll!"</p>

<p>"I should think you could hold your own, Miss
Vrain."</p>

<p>"Not against treachery and lies!" retorted Diana
fiercely. "It is not my habit to employ such weapons,
but my stepmother used no others. It was she
who drove me out of the house and made me exile
myself to the Antipodes to escape her falseness.
And it was she," added Miss Vrain solemnly, "who
treated my father so ill as to drive him out of his
own home. Lydia Vrain is not the doll you think
her to be; she is a false, cruel, clever adventuress,
and I hate her&mdash;I hate her with all my heart and
soul!"</p>

<p>This feminine outburst of anger rather bewildered
Denzil, who saw very plainly that Diana was
by no means the lofty angel he had taken her to
be in the first appreciation of her beauty. But her
passion of the moment suited so well with her stately
looks that she seemed rather a Margaret of
Anjou defying York and his faction than an injured
woman concerned with so slight a thing as the rebuke
of one of her own sex for whom she had little
love. Diana saw the surprise expressed on Lucian's
face, and her own flushed a little with annoyance
that she should have betrayed her feelings so openly.
With a vexed laugh, she recovered her temper
and composed demeanour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p><p>"You see I am no saint, Mr. Denzil," she said,
resuming her seat, for in her anger she had risen
to her feet. "But even if I were one, I could not
have restrained myself from speaking as I did.
When you know my stepmother as well as I do&mdash;but
I must talk calmly about her, or you will not
understand my reasons for thinking her concerned
in the terrible fate of my poor father."</p>

<p>"I am all attention, Miss Vrain."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all I know, as concisely as possible,"
she replied, "and you can judge for yourself if I am
right or wrong. Three years ago my father's health
was very bad. Since the death of my mother&mdash;now
some ten years&mdash;he had devoted himself to
hard study, and had lived more or less the life of
a recluse in Berwin Manor. He was writing a history
of the Elizabethan dramatists, and became so
engrossed with the work that he neglected his
health, and consequently there was danger that he
might suffer from brain fever. The doctors ordered
him to leave his books and to travel, in order
that his attention might be distracted by new scenes
and new people. I was to go with him, to see that
he did not resume his studies, so, in an evil hour for
us both, we went to Italy."</p>

<p>"Your father was not mad?" said Lucian, thinking
of the extraordinary behaviour of Vrain in the
square.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Diana indignantly. "He was
a trifle weak in the head from overwork but quite
capable of looking after himself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p><p>"Did he indulge in strong drink?"</p>

<p>Miss Vrain looked scandalised. "My father was
singularly abstemious in eating and drinking," she
said stiffly. "Why do you ask such a question?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," replied Lucian, with all
humility, "but it was reported in Geneva Square
that Berwin&mdash;the name by which your father was
known&mdash;drank too much; and when I met him he
was certainly not&mdash;not quite himself," finished the
barrister delicately.</p>

<p>"No doubt his troubles drove him to take more
than was good for him," said Diana in a low voice.
"Yet I wonder at it, for his health was none of the
best. Sometimes, I admit, he took sleeping draughts
and&mdash;and&mdash;drugs."</p>

<p>"He was consumptive," said Lucian, noticing
Diana's hesitation to speak plainly.</p>

<p>"His chest was weak, and consumption may have
developed itself, but when I left England, almost
two years back, he was certainly not suffering from
that disease. But I see how it is," said Diana,
wringing her hands. "During my short absence,
and under the tyranny of his wife, his physical
health and moral principles gave way. Drink and
consumption! Ah! God! were not these ills enough
but what the woman must add murder to cap them
both?"</p>

<p>"We do not know yet if she is guilty," said Lucian
quietly. "Will you go on with your story,
Miss Vrain? Later on we can discuss these mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ters,
when I am in possession of the facts. You
say it was an evil hour when you went to Italy."</p>

<p>"It was indeed," said Diana sorrowfully, "for
in Florence, at the Pension Donizetti, on the Lung
Arno, we met with Lydia Clyne and her father.
They had only lately arrived in Italy&mdash;from New
York, I suppose&mdash;but already she was said to be
engaged to a needy Italian nobleman named Hercule
Ferruci."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose the Clynes were rich," said
Lucian, "for I know those Italian nobles too well
to suspect that this Count Ferruci would pay attention
to any one but an heiress."</p>

<p>"She was supposed to be rich, Mr. Denzil. All
Americans, for some reason, are supposed to be
millionaires; but after she married my father I
learned that Mr. Clyne had a very moderate fortune
indeed, and his daughter nothing. It was for
that reason that Lydia threw over the count, to
whom she was almost engaged, and began to pay
attention to my father. She heard talk of his estates
in the gossip of the Pension, and believing him to
be rich, she decided to marry him instead of throwing
herself away in a romantic fit on Ferruci."</p>

<p>"Did she love this Italian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure she did; and, what is more, she
loves him still!"</p>

<p>"What! Is Count Ferruci still acquainted with
Mrs. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"He is, as you shall hear. Miss Clyne, as I said,
determined to make a rich marriage by becoming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>the second Mrs. Vrain. I never liked her, knowing
that she was false and frivolous; but though I
did my best to stop the marriage, my father would
not be controlled. You know that this woman is
pretty and fascinating."</p>

<p>"She is certainly the first, but not the last," interposed
Lucian.</p>

<p>"At all events," resumed Diana disconsolately,
"she was sufficiently fascinating to snare my poor
foolish old father. We remained four months in
Florence, and before we left it Lydia Clyne became
Mrs. Vrain. I could do nothing with my
father, as he was possessed of the headstrong passion
of an old man, and, moreover, Lydia had
learned to know his weak points so well that she
could twist him round her finger. But, angered as
I was at my father's folly, I loved him too well to
leave him at the time, therefore I returned to Berwin
Manor with the pair.</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Denzil," continued Miss Vrain, her
face growing dark, "Lydia made my life so wretched,
and insulted me so openly, that I was forced,
out of self-respect, to leave the house. I had some
relatives in Australia, to whom I went out on a
visit. Alas! I wish I had not done so; yet remain
with my colonial cousins I did, until recalled to
England by the terrible intelligence of my father's
untimely end."</p>

<p>"So the marriage was a failure?"</p>

<p>"Yes; even before I left, Lydia openly neglected
my father. I am bound to say that Mr. Clyne, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>is much the better of the two, tried to make her
conduct herself in a more becoming manner. But
she defied him and every one else. After my departure
I received letters from a friend of mine,
who told me that Lydia had invited Count Ferruci
over on a visit. My father, finding that he could
do nothing, and seeing what a mistake he had made,
returned to his books, and soon became ill again.
Instead of looking after him, Lydia&mdash;as I heard&mdash;encouraged
him to study hard, hoping, no doubt,
that he would die, and that she would be free to
marry Count Ferruci. Then my father left the
house."</p>

<p>"Why? That is a very necessary detail."</p>

<p>Diana thought for a moment, then shook her
head despondingly. "That I cannot explain," she
said, with a sigh, "as I was in Australia at the time.
But I expect that his brain grew weaker with study,
and perhaps with the strong drink and drugs which
this woman drove him to take. No doubt the poor
man grew jealous of Ferruci; and, unable to assert
himself, seeing how ill he was, left the house and
retired to Geneva Square to meet his death, as we
know."</p>

<p>"But all this is supposition," remonstrated Lucian.
"We really do not know why Mr. Vrain
left the house."</p>

<p>"What does Lydia say?"</p>

<p>"She gives no feasible explanation."</p>

<p>"Nor will she. Oh!" cried Diana, "is there no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>way of getting at the truth of this matter? I feel
certain that Lydia and the Count are guilty!"</p>

<p>"You have no proofs," said Denzil, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"No proofs! Why, you said yourself that a
stiletto&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is a supposition on my part," interrupted
Lucian quickly. "I cannot say for certain that the
deed was committed with such a weapon. Besides,
if it was, how can you connect the Italian with
the deed?"</p>

<p>"Can we not find a proof?"</p>

<p>"I fear not."</p>

<p>"But if we search the house?"</p>

<p>"There is little use in doing that," rejoined Lucian.
"However, if it will give you any satisfaction,
Miss Vrain, I will take you over the house
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Do!" cried Diana, "and we may find proof of
Lydia's guilt in a way she little dreams of. Good-bye,
Mr. Denzil&mdash;till to-morrow."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE PARTI-COLOURED RIBBON</h3>


<p>The beauty and high spirit of Diana made so
deep an impression on Lucian that he determined
to aid her by every means in his power in searching
for the assassin of her father. As yet Denzil had
reached the age of twenty-five without having been
attracted in any marked degree towards woman-kind;
or, to put it more precisely, he had not yet
been in love. But now it seemed that the hour
which comes to all of Adam's sons had come to
him; for on leaving Diana he thought of nothing
else but her lovely face and charming smile, and,
until he met her again, her image was never absent
from his mind.</p>

<p>He took but a languid interest in his daily business
or social pursuits, and, wrapped up in inwardly
contemplating the beauties of Diana, he appeared
to move amongst his fellow-men like one in a
dream. And dreamer he was, for there was no substantial
basis for his passion.</p>

<p>Many people&mdash;particularly those without imagination&mdash;scoff
at the idea that love can be born in a
moment, but such is often the case, for all their
ill-advised jibes. A man may be brought into con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>tact
with the loveliest and most brilliant of women,
yet remain heart-whole; yet unexpectedly a face&mdash;not
always the most beautiful&mdash;will fire him with
sudden fervour, even against his better judgment.
Love is not an affair of reason, to be clipped and
measured by logic and calculation; but a devouring,
destroying passion, impatient of restraint, and utterly
regardless of common sense. It is born of
a look, of a smile, of a sigh, of a word; it springs
up and fructifies more speedily than did Jonah's
gourd, and none can say how it begins or how it
will end. It is the ever old, ever new riddle of
creation, and the more narrowly its mystery is
looked into the more impossible does it become
of solution. The lover of to-day, with centuries
of examples at his back, is no wiser in knowledge
than was his father Adam.</p>

<p>Although Lucian was thus stricken mad after
the irrational methods of Cupid, he had sufficient
sense not to examine too minutely into the reasons
for this sudden passion. He was in love, and admitting
as much to himself, there was an end of all
argument. The long lane of his youthful and loveless
life had turned in another direction at the signpost
of a woman's face, and down the new vista
the lover saw flowering meadows, silver streams,
bowers of roses, and all the landscape of Arcadia.
He was a piping swain and Diana a complaisant
shepherdess; but they had not yet entered into the
promised Arcadia, and might never do so unless
Diana was as kindly as he wished her to be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p><p>Lucian was in love with Diana, but as yet he
could not flatter himself that she was in love with
him, so he resolved to win her affection&mdash;if it was
free to be bestowed&mdash;by doing her will, and her
will was to revenge the death of her father. This
was hardly a pleasant task to Lucian in his then
peace-with-all-the-world frame of mind; but seeing
no other way to gain a closer intimacy with the
lady of his love, he took the bitter with the sweet,
and set his shoulder to the wheel.</p>

<p>The next morning, therefore, Lucian called on
the landlord of No. 13 and requested the keys of
the house. But it appeared that these were not in
the landlord's keeping at the moment.</p>

<p>"I gave them to Mrs. Kebby, the charwoman,"
said Mr. Peacock, a retired grocer, who owned the
greater part of the square. "The house is in such
a state that I thought I'd have it cleaned up a
bit."</p>

<p>"With a view to a possible tenant, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Peacock, with a rueful
shake of his bald head, "although I'm hoping
against hope. But what with the murder and the
ghost, there don't seem much chance of letting it.
What might you be wanting in No. 13, Mr.
Denzil?"</p>

<p>"I wish to examine every room, to find, if possible,
a clue to this crime," explained Lucian, suppressing
the fact that he was to have a companion.</p>

<p>"You'll find nothing, sir. I've looked into every
room myself. However, you'll find Mrs. Kebby
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>cleaning up, and she'll let you in if you ring the
bell. You aren't thinking of taking the house yourself,
I suppose?" added Peacock wishfully.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. My nerves are in good order
just now; I don't want to upset them by inhabiting
a house with so evil a reputation."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's what every one says," sighed the
grocer. "I wish that Berwin, or Vrain, or whatever
he called himself, had chosen some other place
to be killed in."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid people who meet with unexpected
deaths can't arrange these little matters beforehand,"
said Lucian drily, and walked away, leaving
the unfortunate landlord still lamenting over his
unlucky possession of a haunted and blood-stained
mansion.</p>

<p>Before going to No. 13, Lucian walked down
the street leading into Geneva Square, in order to
meet Diana, who was due at eleven o'clock. Punctual
as the barrister was, he found that Miss Vrain,
in her impatience, was before him; for he arrived
to see her dismiss her cab at the end of the street,
and met her half way down.</p>

<p>His heart gave a bound as he saw her graceful
figure, and he felt the hot blood rise to his cheeks
as he advanced to meet her.</p>

<p>Diana, quite unconscious of having, like her
namesake, the moon, caused this springtide of the
heart, could not forbear a glance of surprise, but
greeted her coadjutor without embarrassment and
with all friendliness. Her thoughts were too taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>up with her immediate task of exploring the scene
of the crime to waste time in conjecturing the reason
of the young man's blushes. Yet the instinct
of her sex might have told her the truth, and probably
it would have but that it was blunted, or rather
not exercised, by reason of her preoccupation.</p>

<p>"Have you the key, Mr. Denzil?" said she eagerly.</p>

<p>"No; but I have seen the landlord, and he has
given us permission to go over the house. A charwoman
who is cleaning up the place will let us
in."</p>

<p>"A charwoman," repeated Miss Vrain, stopping
short, "and cleaning up the house! Is it, then,
about to receive a new tenant?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; but the landlord wishes it to be aired
and swept; to keep it in some degree of order, I
presume."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this woman?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kebby."</p>

<p>"The same mentioned in the newspaper reports
as having waited on my unhappy father?"</p>

<p>"The same," replied Lucian, with some hesitation;
"but I would advise you, Miss Vrain, not
to question her too closely about your father."</p>

<p>"Why not? Ah! I see; you think her answers
about his drinking habits will give me pain. No
matter; I am prepared for all that. I don't blame
him so much as those who drove him to intemperance.
Is this the house?" she said, looking ear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>nestly
at the neglected building before which they
were standing.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Lucian, ringing the bell, "it was
in this house that your father came to his untimely
end. And here is Mrs. Kebby."</p>

<p>That amiable crone had opened the door while
the young man was speaking, and now stood eyeing
her visitors with a blear-eyed look of dark suspicion.</p>

<p>"What is't ye want?" she demanded, with a
raven-like croak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peacock has given this lady and myself
permission to go over the house," responded Lucian,
trying to pass.</p>

<p>"And how do I know if he did?" grumbled Mrs.
Kebby, blocking the way.</p>

<p>"Because I tell you so."</p>

<p>"And because I am the daughter of Mr. Vrain,"
said Diana, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"Lord love ye, miss! are ye?" croaked Mrs.
Kebby, stepping aside. "And ye've come to look at
your pa's blood, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>Diana turned pale and shuddered, but controlling
herself by an effort of will, she swept past the old
woman and entered the sitting-room. "Is this the
place?" she asked Lucian, who was holding the
door open.</p>

<p>"That it is, miss," cried the charwoman, who had
hobbled after them, "and yonder is the poor gentleman's
blood; it soaked right through the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>pet,"
added Mrs. Kebby, with ghoulish relish.
"Lor! 'ow it must 'ave poured out!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, woman!" said Lucian roughly,
seeing that Diana looked as though about to
faint. "Get on with your work!"</p>

<p>"I'm going; it's upstairs I'm sweeping," growled
the crone, retreating. "You'll bring me to you if
ye give a holler. I'll show ye round for a shilling."</p>

<p>"You shall have double if you leave us alone,"
said Lucian, pointing to the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kebby's blear eyes lighted up, and she
leered amiably at the couple.</p>

<p>"I dessay it's worth two shillings," she said,
chuckling hoarsely. "Oh, I'm not so old but what
I don't know two turtle doves. He! he! To kiss
over yer father's blood! Lawks! what a match
'twill be! He! he!"</p>

<p>Still laughing hoarsely, Mrs. Kebby, in the midst
of her unholy joy, was pushed out of the door by
Lucian, who immediately afterwards turned to see
if Diana had overheard her ill-chosen and ominous
words. But Miss Vrain, with a hard, white face,
was leaning against the wall, and gave no sign of
such knowledge. Her eyes were fixed on a dull-looking
red stain of a dark hue, irregular in shape,
and her hands the while were pressed closely against
her bosom, as though she felt a cruel pain in her
heart. With bloodless cheek and trembling lip the
daughter looked upon the evidence of her father's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>death. Lucian was alarmed by her unnatural pallor.</p>

<p>"Miss Vrain!" he exclaimed, starting forward,
"you are ill! Let me lead you out of this house."</p>

<p>"No!" said Diana, waving him back. "Not till
we examine every inch of it; don't speak to me,
please. I wish to use my eyes rather than my
tongue."</p>

<p>Denzil, both as a lover and a friend, respected
this emotion of the poor young lady, so natural under
the circumstances; and in silence conducted her
from room to room. All were empty and still
dusty, for Mrs. Kebby's broom swept sufficiently
light, and the footfalls of the pair echoed hollowly
in the vast spaces.</p>

<p>Diana looked into every corner, examined every
fireplace, attempted every window, but in no place
could she find any extraneous object likely to afford
a clue to the crime. They went down into the
basement and explored the kitchen, the servant's
parlour, the scullery, and the pantry, but with the
same unsatisfactory result. The kitchen door, which
led out into the back yard, showed signs of having
been lately opened; but when Diana drew Lucian's
attention to this fact, as the murderer having possibly
entered thereby, he assured her that it had
only lately been opened by the detective, Link, when
he was searching for clues.</p>

<p>"I saw this door," added Lucian, striking it with
his cane, "a week before your father was killed.
He showed it to me himself, to prove that no one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>could have entered the house during his absence;
and I was satisfied then, from the rusty condition
of the bolts, and the absence of the key in the lock,
that the door had not been opened&mdash;at all events,
during his tenancy."</p>

<p>"Then how could those who killed him have entered?"</p>

<p>"That is what I wish to learn, Miss Vrain. But
why do you speak in the plural?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe that Lydia and Ferruci killed
my father."</p>

<p>"But I have proved to you that Mrs. Vrain remained at Bath."</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Diana quickly, "but she sent
Ferruci up to kill my father, and I speak in the plural
because I think&mdash;in a moral sense&mdash;she is as
guilty as the Italian."</p>

<p>"That may be, Miss Vrain, but as yet we have
not proved their guilt."</p>

<p>Diana made no answer, but, followed by Lucian,
ascended to the upper part of the house, where they
found Mrs. Kebby sweeping so vigorously that she
had raised a kind of dust storm. As soon as she
saw the couple she hobbled towards them to cajole
them, if possible, into giving her money.</p>

<p>For a few moments Diana looked at her haughtily,
not relishing the familiarity of the old dame,
but unexpectedly she stepped forward with a look
of excitement.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that ribbon?" she asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Mrs Kebby, pointing to a scrap of personal adornment
on the neck of the rusty old creature.</p>

<p>"This?" croaked Mrs. Kebby. "I picked it up
in the kitchen downstairs. It's a pretty red and yaller
thing, but of no value, miss, so I don't s'pose
you'll take it orf me."</p>

<p>Paying no attention to this whimpering, Diana
twitched the ribbon out of the old woman's hands
and examined it. It was a broad yellow ribbon of
rich silk, spotted with red&mdash;very noticeably and evidently
of foreign manufacture.</p>

<p>"It is the same!" cried Diana, greatly excited.
"Mr. Denzil, I bought this ribbon myself in Florence!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucian, wondering at her excitement,
"and what does that prove?"</p>

<p>"This: that a stiletto which my father bought in
Florence, at the same time, has been used to kill
him! I tied this ribbon myself round the handle of
the stiletto!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>FURTHER DISCOVERIES</h3>


<p>The silence which followed Diana's announcement
regarding the ribbon and stiletto&mdash;for Lucian
kept silence out of sheer astonishment&mdash;was broken
by the hoarse voice of Mrs. Kebby:</p>

<p>"If ye want the ribbon, miss, I'll not say no to a
shilling. With what your good gentleman promised,
that will be three as I'm ready to take," and
Mrs. Kebby held out a dirty claw for the silver.</p>

<p>"You'll sell it, will you!" cried out Diana indignantly,
pouncing down on the harridan. "How
dare you keep what isn't yours? If you had shown
the detective this," shaking the ribbon in Mrs.
Kebby's face, "he might have caught the criminal!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interposed Lucian, finding his
voice, "I hardly think so, Miss Vrain; for no one
but yourself could have told that the ribbon adorned
the stiletto. Where did you see the weapon last?"</p>

<p>"In the library at Berwin Manor. I hung it up
on the wall myself, by this ribbon."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is the same ribbon?"</p>

<p>"I am certain," replied Diana emphatically. "I
cannot be mistaken; the colour and pattern are both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>peculiar. Where did you find it?" she added, turning
to Mrs. Kebby.</p>

<p>"In the kitchen, I tell ye," growled the old
woman sullenly. "I only found it this blessed morning.
'Twas in a dark corner, near the door as leads
down to the woodshed. How was I to know 'twas
any good?"</p>

<p>"Did you find anything else?" asked Lucian
mildly.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, sir."</p>

<p>"Not a stiletto?" demanded Diana, putting the
ribbon in her pocket.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's a stiletter, miss; but I
didn't find nothing; and I ain't a thief, though some
people as sets themselves above others by taking
ribbons as doesn't belong to 'em mayn't be much
good."</p>

<p>"The ribbon is not yours," said Diana haughtily.</p>

<p>"Yes it are! Findings is keepings with me!" answered
Mrs. Kebby.</p>

<p>"Don't anger her," whispered Denzil, touching
Miss Vrain's arm. "We may find her useful."</p>

<p>Diana looked from him to the old woman, and
opened her purse, at the sight of which Mrs. Kebby's
sour face relaxed. When Miss Vrain gave her
half a sovereign she quite beamed with joy. "The
blessing of heaven on you, my dear," she said, with
a curtsey. "Gold! good gold! Ah! this is a brave
day's work for me&mdash;thirteen blessed shillings!"</p>

<p>"Ten, you mean, Mrs. Kebby!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," cried Mrs. Kebby obsequiously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>"the lady gave me ten, bless her heart, but you've
quite forgot your three."</p>

<p>"I said two."</p>

<p>"Ah! so you did, sir. I'm a poor schollard at
'rithmetic."</p>

<p>"You're clever enough to get money out of people,"
said Diana, who was disgusted at the avarice
of the hag. "However, for the present you must
be content with what I have given you. If, in
cleaning this house, you find any other article, whatever
it may be, you shall have another ten shillings,
on consideration that you take it at once to Mr.
Denzil."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kebby, who was tying up the piece of gold
in the corner of her handkerchief, nodded her old
head with much complacency. "I'll do it, miss;
that is, if the gentleman will pay on delivery. I
like cash."</p>

<p>"You shall have cash," said Lucian, laughing;
and then, as Diana intimated her intention of leaving
the house, he descended the stairs in her company.</p>

<p>Miss Vrain kept silence until they were outside
in the sunshine, when she cast an upward glance at
the warm blue sky, dappled with light clouds.</p>

<p>"I am glad to be out of that house," she said,
with a shudder. "There is something in its dark
and freezing atmosphere which chills my spirits."</p>

<p>"It is said to be haunted, you know," said Lucian
carelessly; then, after a pause, he spoke on the subject
which was uppermost in his mind. "Now that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>you have this piece of evidence, Miss Vrain, what
do you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"Make sure that I have made no mistake, Mr.
Denzil. I shall go down to Berwin Manor this
afternoon. If the stiletto is still hanging on the
library wall by its ribbon, I shall admit my mistake;
if it is absent, why then I shall return to town and
consult with you as to what is best to be done. You
know I rely on you."</p>

<p>"I shall do whatever you wish, Miss Vrain," said
Lucian fervently.</p>

<p>"It is very good of you," replied the lady gratefully,
"For I have no right to take up your time in
this manner."</p>

<p>"You have every right&mdash;that is, I mean&mdash;I
mean," stammered Denzil, thinking from the surprised
look of Miss Vrain that he had gone too far
at so early a stage of their acquaintance. "I mean
that as a briefless barrister I have ample time at
my command, and I shall only be too happy to place
it and myself at your service. And moreover," he
added in a lighter tone, "I have some selfish interest
in the matter, also, for it is not every one who
finds so difficult a riddle as this to solve. I shall
never rest easy in my mind until I unravel the whole
of this tangled skein."</p>

<p>"How good you are!" cried Diana, impulsively
extending her hand. "It is as impossible for me to
thank you sufficiently now for your kindness as it
will be to reward you hereafter, should we succeed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p><p>"As to my reward," said Lucian, retaining her
hand longer than was necessary, "we can decide
what I merit when your father's death is avenged."</p>

<p>Diana coloured and turned away her eyes,
withdrawing her hand in the meantime from the too
warm clasp of the young man. A sense of his meaning
was suddenly borne in upon her by look and
clasp, and she felt a maidenly confusion at the
momentary boldness of this undeclared lover.
However, with feminine tact she laughed off the hint,
and shortly afterwards took her leave, promising to
communicate as speedily as possible with Lucian
regarding the circumstances of her visit to Bath.</p>

<p>The barrister wished to escort her back to the
Royal John Hotel in Kensington, but Miss Vrain,
guessing his feelings, would not permit this; so
Lucian, hat in hand, was left standing in Geneva
Square, while his divinity drove off in a prosaic
hansom. With her went the glory of the sunlight,
the sweetness of the spring; and Denzil, more in
love than ever, sighed hugely as he walked slowly
back to his lodgings.</p>

<p>For doleful moods, hard work and other interests
are the sole cure; therefore, that same afternoon
Lucian returned to explore the Silent House on his
own account. It had struck him as suggestive that
the parti-coloured ribbon to which Diana attached
such importance should have been found in so out-of-the-way
a corner as the threshold of the door
which conducted to what Mrs. Kebby, with
characteristic misrepresentation, called the woodshed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>In reality the place in question was a cellar, which
extended under the soil of the back yard, and was
lighted from the top by a skylight placed on a level
with the ground.</p>

<p>On being admitted again by Mrs. Kebby, and
sending that ancient female to her Augean task of
cleansing the house, Lucian descended to the basement
in order to examine kitchen and cellar more
particularly. If, as Diana stated, the ribbon had
been knotted loosely about the hilt of the stiletto,
it must have fallen off unnoticed by the assassin
when, weapon in hand, he was retreating from the
scene of crime.</p>

<p>"He must have come down here from the sitting-room,"
mused Denzil, as he stood in the cool,
damp kitchen. "And&mdash;as the ribbon was found
by Mrs. Kebby near yonder door&mdash;it is most probable
that he left the kitchen by that passage for
the cellar. Now it remains for me to find out how
he made his exit from the cellar; and also I must
look for the stiletto, which he possibly dropped in
his flight, as he did the ribbon."</p>

<p>While thus soliloquising, Denzil lighted a candle
which he had taken the precaution to bring with
him for the purpose of making his underground
explorations. Having thus provided himself with
means to dispel the darkness, he stepped into the
door and descended the stone stairs which led to
the cellars.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steps he found himself in a
passage running from the front to the back of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>house, and forthwith turned to the right in order
to reach the particular cellar, which was dug out
in the manner of a cave under the back yard.</p>

<p>This, as Lucian ascertained by walking round,
was faced with stone and had bins on all four sides
for the storage of wine. Overhead there was a
glass skylight, of which the glass was so dusty
and dirty that only a few rays of light could struggle
into the murky depths below. But what particularly
attracted the attention of Denzil was a
short wooden ladder lying on the stone pavement,
and which probably was used to reach the wine in
the upper bins.</p>

<p>"And I should not be surprised if it had been
used for another purpose," murmured Lucian,
glancing upward at the square aperture of the skylight.</p>

<p>It struck him as possible that a stranger could
enter thereby and descend by the ladder. To test
the truth of this he reared the ladder in the middle
of the cellar so that its top rung rested against
the lower edge of the square overhead. Ascending
carefully&mdash;for the ladder was by no means stout&mdash;he
pushed the glass frame upward and found that
it yielded easily to a moderate amount of strength.
Climbing up, step after step, Lucian arose through
the aperture like a genie out of the earth, and soon
found that he could jump easily out of the cellar
into the yard.</p>

<p>"Good!" he exclaimed, much gratified by this
discovery. "I now see how the assassin entered.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>No wonder the kitchen door was bolted and barred,
and that no one was seen to visit Vrain by the front
door. Any one who knew the position of that skylight
could obtain admission easily, at any hour,
by descending the ladder and passing through cellar
and kitchen to the upper part of the house. So
much is clear, but I must next discover how those
who entered got into this yard."</p>

<p>And, indeed, there seemed no outlet, for the
yard was enclosed on three sides by a fence of palings
the height of a man, and rendered impervious
to damp by a coating of tar; on the fourth side by
the house itself. Only over the fence&mdash;which was
no insuperable obstacle&mdash;could a stranger have
gained access to the yard; and towards the fence
opposite to the house Lucian walked. In it there
was no gate, or opening of any kind, so it would
appear that to come into the yard a stranger would
need to climb over, a feat easily achieved by a
moderately active man.</p>

<p>As Denzil examined this frail barrier his eye
was caught by a fluttering object on the left&mdash;that
is, the side in a line with the skylight. This he
found was the scrap of a woman's veil of thin black
gauze spotted with velvet. At once his thoughts
reverted to the shadow of the woman on the blind,
and the suspicions of Diana Vrain.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" he thought, "can that doll
of a Lydia be guilty, after all?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE VEIL AND ITS OWNER</h3>


<p>As may be surmised, Lucian was considerably
startled by the discovery of this important evidence
so confirmative of Diana's suspicions. Yet the
knowledge which Link had gained relative to Mrs.
Vrain's remaining at Berwin Manor to keep Christmas
seemed to contradict the fact; and he could
by no means reconcile her absence with the presence
on the fence of the fragment of gauze; still
less with the supposition that she must have climbed
over a tolerably difficult obstacle to enter the yard,
let alone the necessity&mdash;by no means easy to a
woman&mdash;of descending into the disused cellar by
means of a shaky and fragile ladder.</p>

<p>"After all," thought Lucian, when he was seated
that same evening at his dinner, "I am no more
certain that the veil is the property of Mrs. Vrain
than I am that she was the woman whose shadow
I saw on the blind. Whosoever it was that gained
entrance by passing over fence and through cellar,
must have come across the yard belonging to the
house facing the other road. Therefore, the person
must be known to the owner of that house, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>I must discover who the owner is. Miss Greeb
will know."</p>

<p>Lucian made this last remark with the greatest
confidence, as he was satisfied, from a long acquaintance
with his landlady, that there was very little
concerning her own neighbourhood of which she
was ignorant. The result verified his belief, for
when Miss Greeb came in to clear the table&mdash;a
duty she invariably undertook so as to have a chance
of conversing with her admired lodger&mdash;she was
able to afford him the fullest information on the
subject. The position of the house in question; the
name of its owner; the character of its tenants; she
was thoroughly well posted up in every item, and
willingly imparted her knowledge with much detail
and comment.</p>

<p>"No. 9 Jersey Street," said she, unhesitatingly;
"that is the number of the house at the back of the
haunted mansion, Mr. Denzil. I know it as well
as I know my ten fingers."</p>

<p>"To whom does it belong?" asked Lucian.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peacock; he owns most of the property
round about here, having bought up the land when
the place was first built on. He's seventy years of
age, you know, Mr. Denzil," continued Miss Greeb
conversationally, "and rich!&mdash;Lord! I don't know
how rich he is! Building houses cheap and letting
them dear; he has made more out of that than
in sanding his sugar and chicorying his coffee.
He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is the name of the tenant?" interrupted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Lucian, cutting short this rapid sketch of Peacock's
life.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bensusan, one of the largest women hereabouts."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"Fat, Mr. Denzil. She turns the scale at eighteen
stone, and has pretty well broke every weighing
machine in the place."</p>

<p>"What reputation has she, Miss Greeb?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty good," said the little woman, shrugging
her shoulders, "though they do say she overcharges
and underfeeds her lodgers."</p>

<p>"She keeps a boarding-house, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, she lets rooms," explained Miss Greeb in
a very definite manner, "and those who live in them
supply their own food, and pay for service and
kitchen fire."</p>

<p>"Who is with her now?"</p>

<p>"No one," replied the landlady promptly. "She's
had her bill up these three months. Her last lodger
left about Christmas."</p>

<p>"What is his name&mdash;or her name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was a 'he,'" said Miss Greeb, smiling.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bensusan prefers gentlemen, who are out of
doors all day, to ladies muddling and meddling all
day about the house. I must say I do, too, Mr.
Denzil," ended the lady, with a fascinating glance.</p>

<p>"What is his name, Miss Greeb?" repeated Lucian,
quite impervious to the hint.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Miss Greeb, discomfited at
the result of her failure. "A queer name that had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>to do with payments. Bill as the short for William.
No, it wasn't that, although it does suggest an account.
Quarterday? No. But it had something
to do with quarter-days. Rent!" finished Miss
Greeb triumphantly. "Rent, with a 'W' before
it."</p>

<p>"W-r-e-n-t!" spelled Lucian.</p>

<p>"Yes. Wrent! Mr. Wrent. A strange name,
Mr. Denzil&mdash;a kind of charade, as I may say. He
was with Mrs. Bensusan six months; came to her
house about the time Mr. Berwin hired No. 13."</p>

<p>"Very strange!" assented Lucian, to stop further
comment. "What kind of a man was this Mr.
Wrent?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never heard much about him,"
replied Miss Greeb regretfully. "May I ask why
you want to know all this, Mr. Denzil?"</p>

<p>Lucian hesitated, as he rather dreaded the chattering
tongue of his landlady, and did not wish his
connection with the Vrain case to become public
property in Geneva Square. Still, Miss Greeb was
a valuable ally, if only for her wide acquaintance
with the neighbourhood, its inhabitants, and their
doings. Therefore, after a moment's reflection, he
resolved to secure Miss Greeb as a coadjutor, and
risk her excessive garrulity.</p>

<p>"Can you keep a secret, Miss Greeb?" he asked,
with impressive solemnity.</p>

<p>Struck by his serious air, and at once on fire with
curiosity to learn its reason, Miss Greeb loudly
protested that she should sooner die than breathe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>a word of what her lodger was about to divulge.
She hinted, with many a mysterious look and nod,
that secrets endangering the domestic happiness of
every family in the square were known to her, and
appealed to the fact that such families still lived
in harmony as a proof that she was to be trusted.</p>

<p>"Wild horses wouldn't drag out of me what I
know!" cried Miss Greeb earnestly. "You can confide
in me as you would in a"&mdash;she was about to
say mother, but recollecting her juvenile looks, substituted
the word "sister."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Lucian, explaining just as
much as would serve his purpose. "Then I may
tell you, Miss Greeb, that I suspect the assassin
of Mr. Vrain entered through Mrs. Bensusan's
house, and so got into the yard of No. 13."</p>

<p>"Lord!" cried Miss Greeb, taken by surprise.
"You don't say, sir, that Mr. Wrent is a murdering
villain, steeped in gore?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" replied Lucian, smiling at this highly-coloured
description. "Do not jump to conclusions,
Miss Greeb. So far as I am aware, this Mr. Wrent
you speak of is innocent. Do you know Mrs. Bensusan
and her house well?"</p>

<p>"I've visited both several times, Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell me," continued the barrister,
"is the house built with a full frontage like those
in this square? I mean, to gain Mrs. Bensusan's
back yard is it necessary to go through Mrs. Bensusan's
house?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Greeb, shutting her eyes to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>conjure up the image of her friend's premises. "You
can go round the back through the side passage
which leads in from Jersey Road."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Lucian in a dissatisfied tone. "That
complicates matters."</p>

<p>"How so, sir?" demanded the curious landlady.</p>

<p>"Never mind just now, Miss Greeb. Do you
think you could draw me a plan of this passage of
Mrs. Bensusan's house, and of No. 13, with the
yards between?"</p>

<p>"I never could sketch," said Miss Greeb regretfully,
"and I am no artist, Mr. Denzil, but I think
I can do what you want."</p>

<p>"Here is a sheet of paper and a pencil. Will
you sketch me the houses as clearly as you can?"</p>

<p>With much reflection and nibbling of the pencil,
and casting of her eyes up to the ceiling to aid her
memory, Miss Greeb in ten minutes produced the
required sketch.</p>

<p>"There you are, Mr. Denzil," said Miss Greeb,
placing this work of art before the barrister, "that's
as good as I can draw."</p>

<p>"It is excellent, Miss Greeb," replied Lucian,
examining the plan. "I see that anyone can get
into Mrs. Bensusan's yard through the side passage."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but I don't think a person could without
being seen by Mrs. Bensusan or Rhoda."</p>

<p>"Who is Rhoda?"</p>

<p>"The servant. She's as sharp as a needle, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>an idle slut, for all that, Mr. Denzil. They say
she's a gypsy of some kind."</p>

<p>"Is the gate of this passage locked at night?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Then what is to prevent any one coming in
under cover of darkness and climbing the fence?
He would escape then being seen by the landlady
and her servant."</p>

<p>"I daresay; but he'd be seen climbing over the
fence from the back windows of the houses on each
side of No. 13."</p>

<p>"Not if he chose a dark night for the climbing."</p>

<p>"Well, even if he did, how could he get into
No. 13?" argued Miss Greeb. "You know I've
read the report of the case, Mr. Denzil, and it
couldn't be found out (as the kitchen door was
locked, and no stranger entered the square) how the
murdering assassin got in."</p>

<p>"I may discover even that," replied Lucian, not
choosing to tell Miss Greeb that he had already discovered
the entrance. "With time and inquiry and
observation we can do much. Thank you, Miss
Greeb," he continued, slipping the drawing of the
plan into his breast coat pocket. "I am much
obliged for your information. Of course you'll repeat
our conversation to no one?"</p>

<p>"I swear to breathe no word," said Miss Greeb
dramatically, and left the room greatly pleased with
this secret understanding, which had quite the air
of an innocent intrigue such as was detailed in
journals designed for the use of the family circle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p><p>For the next day or two Lucian mused over the
information he had obtained, and made a fresh
drawing of the plan for his own satisfaction; but
he took no steps on this new evidence, as he was
anxious to submit his discoveries to Miss Vrain
before doing so. At the present time Diana was
at Bath, taking possession of her ancestral acres,
and consulting the family lawyer on various matters
connected with the property.</p>

<p>Once she wrote to Lucian, advising him that she
had heard several pieces of news likely to be useful
in clearing up the mystery; but these she refused
to communicate save at a personal interview. Denzil
was thus kept in suspense, and unable to rest
until he knew precisely the value of Miss Vrain's
newly acquired information; therefore it was with
a feeling of relief that he received a note from her
asking him to call at three o'clock on Sunday at
the Royal John Hotel.</p>

<p>Since her going and coming a week had elapsed.</p>

<p>Now that his divinity had returned, and he was
about to see her again, the sun shone once more
in the heavens for Lucian, and he arrayed himself
for his visit with the utmost care. His heart beat
violently and his colour rose as he was ushered into
the little sitting-room, and he thought less of the
case at the moment than of the joy in seeing Miss
Vrain once more, in hearing her speak, and watching
her lovely face.</p>

<p>On her part, Diana, recollecting their last meeting,
or more particularly their parting, blushed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>her turn, and gave her hand to the barrister with
a new-born timidity. She also was inclined to like
Lucian more than was reasonable for the peace of
her heart; so these two people, each drawn to the
other, should have come together as lovers even at
this second meeting.</p>

<p>But, alas! for the prosaicness of this workaday
world, they had to assume the attitudes of lawyer
and client; and discourse of crime instead of love.
The situation was a trifle ironical, and must have
provoked the laughter of the gods.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Miss Vrain, getting to business
as soon as Lucian was seated, "and what have you
found out?"</p>

<p>"A great deal likely to be of service to us. And
you?"</p>

<p>"I!" replied Miss Vrain in a satisfied tone. "I
have discovered that the stiletto with the ribbon is
gone from the library."</p>

<p>"Who took it away?"</p>

<p>"No one knows. I can't find out, although I
asked all the servants; but it has been missing from
its place for some months."</p>

<p>"Do you think Mrs. Vrain took it?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," replied Diana, "but I have made
one discovery about Mrs. Vrain which implicates
her still more in the crime. She was not in Berwin
Manor on Christmas Eve, but in town."</p>

<p>"Really!" said Lucian much amazed. "But
Link was told that she spent Christmas in the
Manor at Bath."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p><p>"So she did. Link asked generally, and was answered
generally. Mrs. Vrain went up to town on
Christmas Eve and returned on Christmas Day;
but," said Diana, with emphasis, "she spent the
night in town, and on that night the murder was
committed."</p>

<p>Lucian produced his pocketbook and took therefrom
the fragment of gauze, which he handed to
Diana.</p>

<p>"I found this on the fence at the back of No.
13," he said. "It is a veil&mdash;a portion of a velvet-spotted
veil."</p>

<p>"A velvet-spotted veil!" cried Diana, looking
at it. "Then it belongs to Lydia Vrain. She usually
wears velvet-spotted veils. Mr. Denzil, the
evidence is complete&mdash;that woman is guilty!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>GOSSIP</h3>


<p>Going by circumstantial evidence, Diana certainly
had good grounds to accuse Mrs. Vrain of
committing the crime, for there were four points
at least which could be proved past all doubt as
incriminating her strongly in the matter.</p>

<p>In the first place, the female shadow on the blind
seen by Lucian, showed that a woman had been in
the habit of entering the house by the secret way
of the cellar, and during the absence of Vrain.</p>

<p>Secondly, the finding of the parti-coloured ribbon
in the Silent House, which had been knotted
round the handle of the stiletto by Diana, and the
absence of the stiletto itself from its usual place
on the wall of the Berwin Manor library, proved
that the weapon had been removed therefrom to
London, and, presumably, used to commit the deed,
seeing that otherwise there was no necessity for its
presence in the Geneva Square mansion.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Diana had discovered that Lydia had
spent the night of the murder in town; and, lastly,
she also declared that the fragment of gauze found
by Lucian on the dividing fence was the property
of Mrs. Vrain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p><p>This quartette of charges was recapitulated by
Diana in support of her accusation of her stepmother.</p>

<p>"I always suspected Lydia as indirectly guilty,"
she declared in concluding her speech for the prosecution,
"but I was not certain until now that she
had actually struck the blow herself."</p>

<p>"But did she?" said Denzil, by no means convinced.</p>

<p>"I do not know what further evidence you require
to prove it," retorted Diana indignantly. "She
was in town on Christmas Eve; she took the stiletto
from the library, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't prove that," interrupted Lucian decidedly.
Then, seeing the look of anger on Diana's
face, he hastened to apologise. "Excuse me, Miss
Vrain," he said nervously. "I am not the less your
friend because I combat your arguments; but in
this case it is necessary to look on both sides of the
question. Is it possible to prove that Mrs. Vrain
removed this dagger?"</p>

<p>"Nobody actually saw it in her possession," replied
Diana, who was more amenable to reason than
the majority of her sex, "but I can prove that the
stiletto, with its ribbon, remained in the library after
the departure of my father. If Lydia did not
take it, who else had occasion to bring it up to
London?"</p>

<p>"Let us say Count Ferruci," suggested Denzil.</p>

<p>Diana pointed to the fragment of the veil lying
on the table. "On the evidence of that piece of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>gauze," she said, "it was Lydia who entered the
house. Again, you saw her shadow on the window
blind."</p>

<p>"I saw two shadows," corrected Lucian hastily,
"those of a man and a woman."</p>

<p>"In plain English, Mr. Denzil, those of Mrs.
Vrain and Count Ferruci."</p>

<p>"We cannot be certain of that."</p>

<p>"But circumstantial evidence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is not always conclusive, Miss Vrain."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, sir, you seem inclined to defend
this woman!"</p>

<p>"Miss Vrain," said Lucian seriously, "if we don't
give her the benefit of every doubt the jury will,
should she be tried on this charge. I admit that
the evidence against this woman is strong, but it
is not certain; and I argue the case looking at it
from her point of view&mdash;the only view which is
likely to be taken by her counsel. If Mrs. Vrain
killed her husband she must have had a strong motive
to do so."</p>

<p>"Well," said Diana impatiently, "there is the
assurance money."</p>

<p>"I don't know if that motive is quite strong
enough to justify this woman in risking her neck,"
responded the barrister. "As Mrs. Vrain of Berwin
Manor she had an ample income, for your
father seems to have left all the rents to her, and
spent but little on himself; also she had an assured
position, and, on the whole, a happy life. Why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>should she risk losing these advantages to gain
more money?"</p>

<p>"She wanted to marry Ferruci," said Diana,
driven to another point of defence. "She was almost
engaged to him before she married my foolish
father; she invited him to Berwin Manor against
the wish of her husband, and showed plainly that
she loved him sufficiently to commit a crime for his
sake. With my father dead, and she in possession
of &pound;20,000, she could hope to marry this Italian."</p>

<p>"Can you prove that she was so reckless?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," replied Miss Vrain defiantly. "The
same person who told me that Lydia was not at
Berwin Manor on Christmas Eve can tell you that
her behaviour with Count Ferruci was the talk of
Bath."</p>

<p>"Who is this person?" asked Lucian, looking
up.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine&mdash;Miss Tyler. I brought her
up with me, so that you should get her information
at first hand. You can see her at once," and Diana
rose to ring the bell.</p>

<p>"One moment," interposed Lucian, before she
could touch the button. "Tell me if Miss Tyler
knows your reason for bringing her up."</p>

<p>"I have not told her directly," said Diana, with
some bluntness, "but as she is no fool, I fancy she
suspects. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I have something to tell you which I
do not wish your friend to hear, unless," added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Lucian significantly, "you desire to take her into
our confidence."</p>

<p>"No," said Diana promptly. "I do not think it
is wise to take her into our confidence. She is rather&mdash;well,
to put it plainly, Mr. Denzil&mdash;rather a
gossip."</p>

<p>"H'm! As such, do you consider her evidence
reliable?"</p>

<p>"We can pick the grains of wheat out of the
chaff. No doubt she exaggerates and garbles, after
the fashion of a scandal-loving woman, but her evidence
is valuable, especially as showing that Lydia
was not at Bath on Christmas Eve. We will tell
her nothing, so she can suspect as much as she likes;
if we do speak freely she will spread the gossip, and
if we don't, she will invent worse facts; so in either
case it doesn't matter. What is it you have to tell
me?"</p>

<p>Lucian could scarcely forbear smiling at Diana's
candidly expressed estimate of her ally's character,
but, fearful of giving offence to his companion, he
speedily composed his features. With much explanation
and an exhibition of Miss Greeb's plan,
he gave an account of his discoveries, beginning
with his visit to the cellar, and ending with the important
conversation with his landlady. Diana listened
attentively, and when he concluded gave it as
her opinion that Lydia had entered the first yard
by the side passage and had climbed over the fence
into the second, "as is clearly proved by the veil,"
she concluded decisively.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p><p>"But why should she take all that trouble, and
run the risk of being seen, when it is plain that your
father expected her?"</p>

<p>"Expected her!" cried Diana, thunderstruck.
"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"I don't know so much about that," replied Lucian
drily, "although I admit that on the face of it
my assertion appears improbable. But when I met
your father the second time, he was so anxious to
prove, by letting me examine the house, that no
one had entered it during his absence, that I am
certain he was well aware the shadows I saw were
those of people he knew were in the room. Now, if
the woman was Mrs. Vrain, she must have been in
the habit of visiting your father by the back way."</p>

<p>"And Ferruci also?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure if the male shadow was Ferruci,
no more than I am certain the other was Mrs.
Vrain."</p>

<p>"But the veil?"</p>

<p>Lucian shrugged his shoulders in despair. "That
seems to prove it was she," he said dubiously, "but
I can't explain your father's conduct in receiving
her in so secretive a way. The whole thing is beyond
me."</p>

<p>"Well, what is to be done?" said Diana, after
a pause, during which they looked blankly at one
another.</p>

<p>"I must think. My head is too confused just
now with this conflicting evidence to plan any line
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>of action. As a relief, let us examine your friend
and hear what she has to say."</p>

<p>Diana assented, and touched the bell. Shortly,
Miss Tyler appeared, ushered in by a nervous waiter,
to whom it would seem she had addressed a
sharp admonition on his want of deference. Immediately
on entering she pounced down on Miss
Vrain like a hawk on a dove, pecked her on both
cheeks, addressed her as "my dearest Di," and
finally permitted herself, with downcast eyes and
a modest demeanour, to be introduced to Lucian.</p>

<p>It might be inferred from the foregoing description
that Miss Tyler was a young and ardent damsel
in her teens; whereas she was considerably nearer
forty than thirty, and possessed an uncomely aspect
unpleasing to male eyes. Her own were of
a cold grey, her lips were thin, her waist pinched
in, and&mdash;as the natural consequence of tight lacing&mdash;her
nose was red. Her scanty hair was drawn
off her high forehead very tightly, and screwed into
a cast-iron knob at the nape of her long neck; and
she smiled occasionally in an acid manner, with
many teeth. She wore a plainly-made green dress,
with a toby frill; and a large silver cross dangled on
her flat bosom. Altogether, she was about as venomous
a specimen of an unappropriated blessing as
can well be imagined.</p>

<p>"Bella," said Miss Vrain to this unattractive female,
"for certain reasons, which I may tell you
hereafter, Mr. Denzil wishes to know if Mrs.
Vrain was at Berwin Manor on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p><p>"Of course she was not, dearest Di," said Bella,
drooping her elderly head on one scraggy shoulder,
with an acid smile. "Didn't I tell you so? I was
asked by Lydia&mdash;alas! I wish I could say my dearest
Lydia&mdash;to spend Christmas at Berwin Manor.
She invited me for my singing and playing, you
know: and as we all have to make ourselves agreeable,
I came to see her. On the day before Christmas
she received a letter by the early post which
seemed to upset her a great deal, and told me she
would have to run up to town on business. She did,
and stayed all night, and came down next morning
to keep Christmas. I thought it <i>very</i> strange."</p>

<p>"What was her business in town, Miss Tyler?"
asked Lucian.</p>

<p>"Oh, she didn't tell <i>me</i>," said Bella, tossing her
head, "at least not directly, but I gathered from
what she said that something was wrong with poor
dear Mr. Clyne&mdash;her father, you know, dearest
Di."</p>

<p>"Was the letter from him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't say that, Mr. Denzil, as I don't
know, and I never speak by hearsay. So much mischief
is done in the world by people repeating idle
tales of which they are not sure."</p>

<p>"Was Count Ferruci at Berwin Manor at the
time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no, Di! I told you that he was
up in London the whole of Christmas week. I only
hope," added Miss Tyler, with a venomous smile,
"that Lydia did not go up to meet him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p><p>"Why should she?" demanded Lucian bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not blind!" cried Bella, shrilly laughing.
"No, indeed. The Count&mdash;a most amiable
man&mdash;was <i>very</i> attentive to me at one time; and
Lydia&mdash;a married woman&mdash;I regret to say, did
not like him being so. I am indeed sorry to repeat
scandal, Mr. Denzil, but the way in which Mrs.
Vrain behaved towards me and carried on with the
Count was not creditable. I am a gentlewoman,
Mr. Denzil, and a churchwoman, and as such cannot
countenance such conduct as his."</p>

<p>"You infer, then, that Mrs. Vrain was in love
with the Italian?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be at all surprised to hear it," cried
Bella again. "But he did not care for her! Oh,
dear, no! It is my belief, Mr. Denzil, that Mrs.
Vrain knows more about the death of her husband
than she chooses to admit. Oh, I've read <i>all</i> the
papers; I know <i>all</i> about the death."</p>

<p>"Miss Tyler!" said Lucian, alarmed.</p>

<p>"Bella!" cried Miss Vrain. "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not blind, dearest," interrupted Bella,
speaking very fast. "I know you ask me these
questions to find out if Lydia killed her husband.
Well, she did!"</p>

<p>"How do you know, Miss Tyler?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm sure of it, Mr. Denzil. Wasn't
Mr. Vrain stabbed with a dagger? Very well, then.
There was a dagger hanging in the library of the
Manor, and I saw it there four days before Christ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>mas.
When I looked for it on Christmas Day it
was gone."</p>

<p>"Gone! Who took it?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vrain!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am!" snapped Miss Tyler. "I didn't
see her take it, but it was there before she went, and
it wasn't there on Christmas Day. If Lydia did
not take it, who did?"</p>

<p>"Count Ferruci, perhaps."</p>

<p>"He wasn't there! No!" cried Bella, raising
her head, "I'm sure Mrs. Vrain stole it and killed
her husband, and I don't care who hears me say
so!"</p>

<p>Diana and Lucian looked at one another in silence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE HOUSE IN JERSEY STREET</h3>


<p>As her listeners made no comment on Miss
Tyler's accusation of Mrs. Vrain, she paused only
for a moment to recover her breath, and was off
again in full cry with a budget of ancient gossip
drawn from a very retentive memory.</p>

<p>"Of the way in which Lydia treated her poor
dear husband I know little," cried the fair Bella.
"Only this, that she drove him out of the house by
her scandalous conduct. Yes, indeed; although you
may not believe me, Di. You were away in Australia
at the time, but I kept a watch on Lydia in
your interest, dear, and our housemaid heard from
your housemaid the most dreadful things. Why,
Mr. Vrain remonstrated with Lydia, and ordered
Count Ferruci out of the house, but Lydia would
not let him go; and Mr. Vrain left the house himself."</p>

<p>"Where did he go to, Miss Tyler?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; nobody knows. But it is my
opinion," said the spinster, with a significant look,
"that he went to London to see about a divorce.
But he was weak in the head, poor man, and I sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>pose
let things go on. When next I heard of him
he was a corpse in Geneva Square."</p>

<p>"But did my father tell his wife that he was in
Geneva Square?"</p>

<p>"Dearest Di, I can't say; but I don't believe he
had anything to do with her after he left the
house."</p>

<p>"Then if she did not know his whereabouts, how
could she kill him?" asked Denzil pertinently.</p>

<p>Brought to a point which she could not evade,
Bella declined to answer this question, but tossed
her head and bit her lip, with a fine colour. All her
accusations of Mrs. Vrain had been made generally,
and, as Lucian noted, were unsupported by
fact. From a legal point of view this spiteful gossip
of a jealous woman was worth nothing, but in
a broad sense it was certainly useful in showing the
discord which had existed between Vrain and his
wife. Lucian saw that little good was to be gained
from this prejudiced witness, so thanking Miss
Tyler courteously for her information, he arose to
go.</p>

<p>"Wait for a moment, Mr. Denzil," said Diana
hurriedly. "I want to ask you something. Bella,
would you mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leaving the room? Oh, dear, no!" burst out
Miss Tyler, annoyed at being excluded. "I've said
all I have to say, and anything I can do, dearest
Di, to assist you and Mr. Denzil in hanging that
woman, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Tyler," interrupted Lucian sternly, "you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>must not speak so wildly, for as yet there is nothing
to prove that Mrs. Vrain is guilty."</p>

<p>"She is guilty enough for me, Mr. Denzil; but
like all men, I suppose you take her side, because
she is supposed to be pretty. Pretty!" reflected
Bella scornfully, "I never could see it myself; a
painted up minx, dragged up from the gutter. I
wonder at your taste, Mr. Denzil, indeed I do.
Pretty, the idea! What fools men are! I'm glad I
never married one! Indeed no! He! he!"</p>

<p>And with a shrill laugh to point this sour-grape
sentiment, and mark her disdain for Lucian, the
fair Bella took herself and her lean form out of
the room.</p>

<p>Diana and the barrister were too deeply interested
in their business to take much notice of Bella's
hysterical outburst, but looked at one another gravely
as she departed.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Denzil," said the former, repeating
her earlier question, "what is to be done now?
Shall we see Mrs. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Lucian quickly. "We must
secure proofs of Mrs. Vrain's being in that yard
before we can get any confession out of her. If
you will leave it in my hands, Miss Vrain, I shall
call on Mrs. Bensusan."</p>

<p>"Who is Mrs. Bensusan?"</p>

<p>"She is the tenant of the house in Jersey Street.
It is possible that she or her servant may know
something about the illegal use made of the right
of way."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p><p>"Yes, I think that is the next step to take. But
what am I to do in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. If I were you I would not even see
Mrs. Vrain."</p>

<p>"I will not seek her voluntarily," replied Diana,
"but as I have been to Berwin Manor she is certain
to hear that I am in England, and may perhaps
find out my address, and call. But if she does, you
may be sure that I will be most judicious in my
remarks."</p>

<p>"I leave all that to your discretion," said Denzil,
rising. "Good-bye, Miss Vrain. As soon as I am
in possession of any new evidence I shall call
again."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Denzil, and thank you for all
your kindness."</p>

<p>Diana made this remark with so kindly a look,
so becoming a blush, and so warm a pressure of
the hand, that Lucian felt quite overcome, and not
trusting himself to speak, walked swiftly out of
the room.</p>

<p>In spite of the gravity of the task in which he
was concerned, at that moment he thought more of
Diana's looks and speech than of the detective business
which he had taken up for love's sake. But
on reaching his rooms in Geneva Square he made
a mighty effort to waken from these day dreams,
and with a stern determination addressed himself
resolutely to the work in hand.</p>

<p>In this case the bitter came before the sweet.
But by accomplishing the desire of Diana, and solv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ing
the mystery of her father's death, Lucian hoped
to win not only her smiles but the more substantial
reward of her heart and hand.</p>

<p>Before calling on Mrs. Bensusan the barrister debated
within himself as to whether it would not be
judicious to call in again the assistance of Link, and
by telling him of the new evidence which had been
found place him thereby in possession of new material
to prosecute the case. But Link lately had
taken so pessimistic a view of the matter that Lucian
fancied he would scoff at his late discoveries, and
discourage him in prosecuting what seemed to be
a fruitless quest.</p>

<p>Denzil was anxious, as Diana's knight, to do
as much of the work as possible in order to gain
the reward of her smiles. It is true that he had
no legal authority to make these inquiries, and it
was possible that Mrs. Bensusan might refuse to
answer questions concerning her own business, unsanctioned
by law; but on recalling the description
of Miss Greeb, Lucian fancied that Mrs. Bensusan,
as a fat woman, might only be good-natured
and timid.</p>

<p>He therefore dismissed all ideas of asking Link
to intervene, and resolved to risk a personal interview
with the tenant of the Jersey Street house. It
would be time enough to invite Link's assistance,
he thought, when Mrs. Bensusan&mdash;as yet an unknown
quantity in the case&mdash;proved obstinate in
replying to his questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensusan proved to be quite as stout as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Miss Greeb had reported. A gigantically fat woman,
she made up in breadth what she lacked in
length. Yet she seemed to have some activity about
her, too, for she opened the door personally to
Lucian, who was quite amazed when he beheld her
monstrous bulk blocking up the doorway. Her
face was white and round like a pale moon; she
had staring eyes of a china blue, resembling the
vacant optics of a wax doll; and, on the whole,
appeared to be a timid, lymphatic woman, likely to
answer any questions put to her in a sufficiently
peremptory tone. Lucian foresaw that he was not
likely to have much trouble with this mountain of
flesh.</p>

<p>"What might you be pleased to want, sir?" she
asked Lucian, in the meekest of voices. "Is it about
the lodgings?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the barrister boldly, for he
guessed that Mrs. Bensusan would scuttle back into
the house like a rabbit to its burrow, did he speak
too plainly at the outset, "that is&mdash;I wish to inquire
about a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Did he lodge here, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A Mr. Wrent."</p>

<p>"Deary me!" said the fat woman, with mild
surprise. "Mr. Wrent left me shortly after Christmas.
A kind gentleman, but timid; he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," interrupted Lucian, who wanted
to get into the house, "but don't you think you could
tell me about my friend in a more convenient situation?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p><p>"Oh, yes, sir&mdash;certainly, sir," wheezed Mrs.
Bensusan, rolling back up the narrow passage. "I
beg your pardon, sir, for my forgetfulness, but my
head ain't what it ought to be. I'm a lone widow,
sir, and not over strong."</p>

<p>Denzil could have laughed at this description,
as the lady's bulk gave the lie to her assertion.
However, on diplomatic grounds he suppressed his
mirth, and followed his ponderous guide into a sitting-room
so small that she almost filled it herself.</p>

<p>As he left the passage he saw a brilliant red head
pop down the staircase leading to the basement;
but whether it was that of a man or a woman he
could not say. Still, on recalling Miss Greeb's description
of the Bensusan household, he concluded
that the red head was the property of Rhoda, the
sharp servant, and argued from her appearance in
the background, and rapid disappearance, that she
was in the habit of listening to conversations she
was not meant to hear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensusan sat down on the sofa, as being
most accommodating to her bulk, and cast a watery
look around the small apartment, which was furnished
in that extraordinary fashion which seems
to be the peculiar characteristic of boarding houses.
The walls and carpet were patterned with glowing
bunches of red roses; the furniture was covered with
stamped red velvet; the ornaments consisted of
shells, wax fruit under glass shades, mats of Berlin
wool, vases with dangling pendants of glass, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>such like elegant survivals of the early Victorian
epoch.</p>

<p>Hideous as the apartment was, it seemed to afford
Mrs. Bensusan&mdash;also a survival&mdash;great pleasure;
and she cast a complacent look around as
Lucian seated himself on an uncomfortable chair
covered with an antimacassar of crochet work.</p>

<p>"My rooms are most comfortable, an' much
liked," said Mrs. Bensusan, sighing, "but I have
not had many lodgers lately. Rhoda thinks it must
be on account of that horrible murder."</p>

<p>"The murder of Vrain in No. 13?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" groaned the fat woman, looking tearfully
over her double chin, "I see you have heard
of it."</p>

<p>"Everybody has heard of it," replied Lucian,
"and I was one of the first to hear, since I live in
Miss Greeb's house, opposite No. 13."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!" grunted Mrs. Bensusan, stiffening
a little at the sound of a rival lodging-house keeper's
name. "Then you are Mr. Denzil, the gentleman
who occupies Miss Greeb's first floor front."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I have come to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>"About what, sir?" said Mrs. Bensusan, visibly
alarmed.</p>

<p>"Concerning Mr. Wrent."</p>

<p>"You are a friend of his?"</p>

<p>"I said so, Mrs. Bensusan, but as a matter of fact
I never set eyes on the gentleman in my life."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensusan gasped like a fish out of water,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>and patted her fat breast with her fat hand, as
though to give herself courage. "It is not like a
gentleman to say that another gentleman's his
friend when he ain't," she said, with an attempt at
dignity.</p>

<p>"Very true," answered Lucian, with great composure,
"but you know the saying, 'All is fair in
love and war.' I will be plain with you, Mrs. Bensusan,"
he added, "I am here to seek possible evidence
in connection with the murder of Mr. Vrain,
in No. 13, on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensusan gave a kind of hoarse screech,
and stared at Lucian in a horrified manner.</p>

<p>"Murder!" she repeated. "Lord! what mur&mdash;that
murder! Mr. Vrain! Mr. Vrain&mdash;that murder!"
she repeated over and over again.</p>

<p>"Yes, the murder of Mr. Vrain in No. 13 Geneva
Square on Christmas Eve. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>With another gasp Mrs. Bensusan threw up her
fat hands and raised her eyes to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"As I am a Christian woman, sir," she cried, "I
am as innocent as a babe unborn!"</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Lucian sharply.</p>

<p>"Of the murder!" wept Mrs. Bensusan, now dissolved
in tears. "Rhoda said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear what Rhoda said," interrupted
Lucian impatiently, "and I am not accusing
you of the murder. But&mdash;your house is at the back
of No. 13."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p><p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Bensusan, weeping like a
Niobe.</p>

<p>"And a fence divides your yard from that of No.
13?"</p>

<p>"I won't contradict you, sir&mdash;it do."</p>

<p>"And there is a passage leading from Jersey
Street into your yard?"</p>

<p>"There is, Mr. Denzil; it's useful for the trades-people."</p>

<p>"And I daresay useful to others," said Lucian
drily. "Now, Mrs. Bensusan, do you know if any
lady was in the habit of passing through that passage
at night?"</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Bensusan could answer the door was
dashed open, and Rhoda, the red-headed, darted
into the room.</p>

<p>"Don't answer, missus!" she cried shortly. "As
you love me, mum, don't!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>RHODA AND THE CLOAK</h3>


<p>The one servant of Mrs. Bensusan was a girl of
seventeen, who had a local fame in the neighbourhood
on account of her sharp tongue and many precocious
qualities. No one knew who her parents
were, or where the fat landlady had picked her up;
but she had been in the Jersey Street house some
ten years, and had been educated and&mdash;in a manner&mdash;adopted
by its mistress, although Mrs. Bensusan
always gave her cronies to understand that Rhoda
was simply and solely the domestic of the establishment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for one of her humble position,
she had a wonderful power over her stout employer,
the power of a strong mind over a weak one,
and in spite of her youth it was well known that
Rhoda managed the domestic economy of the house.
Mrs. Bensusan was the sovereign, Rhoda the prime
minister.</p>

<p>This position she had earned by dint of her own
sharpness in dealing with the world. And the local
tradesmen were afraid of Rhoda. "Mrs. Bensusan's
devil," they called her, and never dared to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>give short weight, or charge extra prices, or pass
off damaged goods as new, when Rhoda was the
purchaser. On the contrary, No. 9 Jersey Street
was supplied with everything of the best, promptly
and civilly, at ordinary market rates; for neither
butcher, nor baker, nor candlestick maker, was daring
enough to risk Rhoda's tongue raging like a
prairie fire over their shortcomings. Several landladies,
knowing Rhoda's value, had tried to entice
her from Mrs. Bensusan by offers of higher wages
and better quarters, but the girl refused to leave
her stout mistress, and so continued quite a fixture
of the lodgings. Even in the city, Rhoda had been
spoken of by clerks who had lived in Jersey Street,
and so had more than a local reputation for originality.</p>

<p>This celebrated handmaid was as lean as her
mistress was stout. Her hair was magnificent in
quality and quantity, but, alas! was of the unpopular
tint called red; not auburn, or copper hued, or
the famous Titian color, but a blazing, fiery red,
which made it look like a comic wig. Her face
was pale and freckled, her eyes black&mdash;in strange
contrast to her hair, and her mouth large, but garnished
with an excellent set of white teeth.</p>

<p>Rhoda was not neat in her attire, perhaps not
having arrived at the age of coquetry, for she wore
a dingy grey dress much too short for her, a pair of
carpet slippers which had been left by a departed
lodger, and usually went about with her sleeves
tucked up, and a resolute look on her sharp face.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Such was the appearance of Mrs. Bensusan's devil,
who entered to forbid her mistress confiding in
Lucian.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rhoda!" groaned Mrs. Bensusan. "You
bad gal! I believe as you've 'ad your ear to the
keyhole."</p>

<p>"I 'ave!" retorted Rhoda defiantly. "It's been
there for five minutes, and good it is for you, mum,
as I ain't above listening. What do you mean, sir,"
she cried, turning on Lucian like a fierce sparrow,
"by coming 'ere to frighten two lone females, and
her as innocent as a spring chicken?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Lucian, looking at her composedly,
"so you are the celebrated Rhoda? I've heard of
you."</p>

<p>"Not much good, then, sir, if Miss Greeb was
talking," rejoined the red-haired girl, with a sniff.
"Oh, I know her."</p>

<p>"Rhoda! Rhoda!" bleated her mistress, "do 'old
your tongue! I tell you this gentleman's a police."</p>

<p>"He ain't!" said the undaunted Rhoda. "He's
in the law. Oh, I knows him!'</p>

<p>"Ain't the law the police, you foolish gal?"</p>

<p>"Of course it&mdash;" began Rhoda, when Lucian,
who thought that she had displayed quite sufficient
eccentricity, cut her short with a quick gesture.</p>

<p>"See here, my girl," he said sharply, "you must
not behave in this fashion. I have reason to believe
that the assassin of Mr. Vrain entered the house
through the premises of your mistress."</p>

<p>"Lawks, what a 'orrible idear!" shrieked Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>Bensusan. "Good 'eavens, Rhoda, did you see the
murdering villain?"</p>

<p>"Me? No! I never sawr nothing, mum," replied
Rhoda doggedly.</p>

<p>Lucian, watching the girl's face, and the uneasy
expression in her eyes, felt convinced she was not
telling the truth. It was no use forcing her to
speak, as he saw very plainly that Rhoda was one
of those obstinate people whom severity only hardened.
Much more could be done with her by kindness,
and Denzil adopted this&mdash;to him&mdash;more congenial
course.</p>

<p>"If Rhoda is bound by any promise, Mrs. Bensusan,
I do not wish her to speak," he said indifferently,
"but in the interests of justice I am sure
you will not refuse to answer my questions."</p>

<p>"Lord, sir! I know nothing!" whimpered the
terrified landlady.</p>

<p>"Will you answer a few questions?" asked Denzil
persuasively.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensusan glanced in a scared manner at
Rhoda, who, meanwhile, had been standing in a
sullen and hesitating attitude. When she thought
herself unobserved, she stole swift glances at the
visitor, trying evidently to read his character by
observation of his face and manner. It would seem
that her scrutiny was favourable, for before Mrs.
Bensusan could answer Lucian's question she asked
him one herself.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know, sir?"</p>

<p>"I want to know all about Mr. Wrent."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p><p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I fancy he has something to do with
this crime."</p>

<p>"Lord!" groaned Mrs. Bensusan. "'Ave I waited
on a murderer?"</p>

<p>"I don't say he is a murderer, Mrs. Bensusan,
but he knows something likely to put us on the track
of the criminal."</p>

<p>"What makes ye take up the case?" demanded
Rhoda sharply.</p>

<p>"Because I know that Mr. Wrent came to board
in this house shortly after Mr. Vrain occupied No.
13," replied Denzil.</p>

<p>"Who says he did?"</p>

<p>"Miss Greeb, my landlady, and she also told
me that he left here two days after the murder."</p>

<p>"That's as true as true!" cried Mrs. Bensusan,
"ain't it, Rhoda? We lost him 'cause he said he
couldn't abide living near a house where a crime
had been committed."</p>

<p>"Well, then," continued Lucian, seeing that
Rhoda, without speaking, continued to watch him,
"the coincidence of Mr. Wrent's stay with that of
Mr. Vrain's strikes me as peculiar."</p>

<p>"You are a sharp one, you are!" said Rhoda,
with an approving nod. "Look here, Mr. Denzil,
would you break a promise?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon what the promise was."</p>

<p>"It was one I made to hold my tongue."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"Several things," said the girl shortly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p><p>"Have they to do with this crime?" asked Lucian
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I can't say," said Rhoda; then
suddenly her face grew black. "I tell you what,
sir, I hate Mr. Wrent!" she declared.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rhoda!" cried Mrs. Bensusan. "After
the lovely cloak he gave you!"</p>

<p>The red-haired girl looked contemptuously at
her mistress; then, without a word, darted out of
the room. Before Lucian could conjecture the reason
of her strange conduct, or Mrs. Bensusan could
get her breath again&mdash;a very difficult operation
for her&mdash;Rhoda was back with a blue cloth cloak,
lined with rabbit skins, hanging over her arm. This
she threw down at the feet of Lucian, and stamped
on it savagely with the carpet slippers.</p>

<p>"There's his present!" she cried angrily, "but
I wish I could dance on him the same way! I wish&mdash;I
wish I could hang him!"</p>

<p>"Can you?" demanded Lucian swiftly, taking
her in the moment of wrath, when she seemed disposed
to speak.</p>

<p>"No!" said Rhoda shortly. "I can't!"</p>

<p>"Do you think he killed Mr. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't!"</p>

<p>"Do you know who did?"</p>

<p>"Blest if I do!"</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Wrent?" asked Denzil meaningly.</p>

<p>The girl wet her finger and went through a childish
game. "That's wet," she said; then wiping the
finger on her dingy skirt, "that's dry. Cut my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>throat if I tell a lie. Ask me something easier, Mr.
Denzil."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Lucian, quite puzzled.</p>

<p>"Rhoda! Rhoda! 'Ave you gone crazy?" wailed
Mrs. Bensusan.</p>

<p>"Look here," said the girl, taking no notice of
her mistress, "do you want to know about Mr.
Wrent?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"And about that side passage as you talked of
to the missis?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll answer yer questions, sir. You'll know
all I know."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Lucian, with an approving
smile, "now you are talking like a sensible girl."</p>

<p>"Rhoda! You ain't going to talk bad of Mr.
Wrent?"</p>

<p>"It ain't bad, and it ain't good," replied Rhoda.
"It's betwixt and between."</p>

<p>"Well, I must 'ear all. I don't want the character
of the 'ouse took away," said Mrs. Bensusan,
with an attempt at firmness.</p>

<p>"That's all right," rejoined Rhoda reassuringly,
"you can jine in yerself when y' like. Fire away,
Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Wrent?" asked Lucian, going
straight to the point.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Rhoda; and henceforth
the examination proceeded as though the girl were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>in the witness-box and Lucian counsel for the prosecution.</p>

<p>Q. When did he come to Jersey Street?</p>

<p>A. At the end of July, last year.</p>

<p>Q. When did he go away?</p>

<p>A. The morning after Boxing Day.</p>

<p>Q. Can you describe his appearance?</p>

<p>A. He was of the middle height, with a fresh
complexion, white hair, and a white beard growing
all over his face. He was untidy about his clothes,
and kept a good deal to his own room among a lot
of books. I don't think he was quite right in his
head.</p>

<p>Q. Did he pay his rent regularly?</p>

<p>A. Yes, except when he was away. He would
go away for a week at a time.</p>

<p>Q. Was he in this house on Christmas Eve?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir. He came back two days before
Christmas.</p>

<p>Q. Where had he been?</p>

<p>A. I don't know; he did not say.</p>

<p>Q. Did he have any visitors?</p>

<p>A. He did. A tall, dark man and a lady.</p>

<p>Q. What was the lady like?</p>

<p>A. A little woman; I never saw her face, as she
always kept her veil down.</p>

<p>Q. What kind of a veil did she wear?</p>

<p>A. A black gauze veil with velvet spots.</p>

<p>Q. Did she come often to see Mr. Wrent?</p>

<p>A. Yes. Four or five times.</p>

<p>Q. When did she call last?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>A. On Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Q. At what hour?</p>

<p>A. She came at seven, and went away at eight.
I know that because she had supper with Mr.
Wrent.</p>

<p>Q. Did she leave the house?</p>

<p>A. Yes. I let her out myself.</p>

<p>Q. Did you ever hear any conversation between
them?</p>

<p>A. No. Mr. Wrent took care of that. I never
got any chance of listening at keyholes with him.
He was a sharp one, for all his craziness.</p>

<p>Q. What was the male visitor like?</p>

<p>A. He was tall and dark, with a black moustache.</p>

<p>Q. Do you think he was a foreigner?</p>

<p>A. I don't know. I never heard him speak. Mr.
Wrent let him out, as usual.</p>

<p>Q. When did he visit Mr. Wrent last?</p>

<h3>MRS. VRAIN AT BAY</h3>


<p>"You saw the dark man in the back yard on
Christmas Eve?" repeated Lucian, much surprised
by this discovery.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," replied Rhoda decisively, "at half-past
eight o'clock. I went out into the yard to
put some empty bottles into the shed, and I saw
the man standing near the fence, looking at the
back of No. 13. When he heard me coming out he
rushed past me and out by the side passage. The
moon was shining, and I saw him as plain as plain."</p>

<p>"Did he seem afraid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did; and didn't want to be seen, neither.
I told Mr. Wrent, and he promised me a cloak if
I held my tongue. He said the dark man was waiting
in the yard until the lady had gone, when he
was coming in again."</p>

<p>"But the lady, you say, went at eight, and you
saw the man half an hour later?"</p>

<p>"That's it, sir. He told me a lie, for he never
came in again to see Mr. Wrent."</p>

<p>"But already the dark man had seen the lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He came in with her at seven, and went
away at half-past."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p><p>Lucian mechanically stooped down and picked up
the fur cloak. He was puzzled by the information
given by Rhoda, and did not exactly see what use
to make of it. Going by the complexion of the
man who had lurked in the back yard, it would
appear that he was Count Ferruci; while the small
stature of the woman, and the fact that she wore
a velvet-spotted veil, indicated that she was Lydia
Vrain; also the pair had been in the vicinity of the
haunted house on the night of the murder; and,
although it was true both were out of the place
by half-past eight, yet they might not have gone
far, but had probably returned later&mdash;when Rhoda
and Mrs. Bensusan were asleep&mdash;to murder Vrain,
between the hours of eleven and twelve on the same
night.</p>

<p>This was all plain enough, but Lucian was puzzled
by the account of Mr. Wrent. Who, he asked
himself repeatedly, who was this grey-haired, white-bearded
man who had so often received Lydia, who
had on Christmas Eve silenced Rhoda regarding
Ferruci's presence in the yard, by means of the
cloak, and who&mdash;it would seem&mdash;possessed the key
to the whole mystery?</p>

<p>Rhoda could tell no more but that he had stayed
six months with Mrs. Bensusan, and had departed
two days after the murder; whereby it would seem
that his task having been completed, he had no
reason to remain longer in so dangerous a neighbourhood.
Yet four months had elapsed since his
departure, and Denzil, after some reflection, asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Mrs. Bensusan a question or two regarding this interval.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Wrent returned here since his departure?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"Lawks! no, sir!" wheezed Mrs. Bensusan,
shaking her head. "I've never set eyes on him
since he went. 'Ave you, Rhoda?" Whereat the
girl shook her head also, and watched Lucian with
an intensity of gaze which somewhat discomposed
him.</p>

<p>"Did he owe you any money when he went, Mrs.
Bensusan?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He paid up like a gentleman. I always
thought well of Mr. Wrent."</p>

<p>"Rhoda doesn't seem to share your sentiments,"
said Denzil drily.</p>

<p>"No, I don't!" cried the servant, frowning. "I
hated Mr. Wrent!"</p>

<p>"Why did you hate him?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, sir," retorted Rhoda grimly.
"I hated him."</p>

<p>"Yet he bought you this cloak."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't!" contradicted the girl. "He got
it from the lady!"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Lucian sharply. "Are you sure
of that?"</p>

<p>"I can't exactly swear to it," replied Rhoda, hesitating,
"but it was this way: The lady wore a
cloak like that, and I admired it awful. She had
it on when she came, Christmas Eve, and she didn't
wear it when I let her out, and the next day Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>Wrent gave it to me. So I suppose it is the same
cloak."</p>

<p>"And did the lady go out into the cold winter
weather without the cloak?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but she had a long cloth jacket on, sir, so
I don't s'pose she missed it."</p>

<p>"Was the lady agitated when she went out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She held her tongue and kept
her veil down."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me anything more?" asked Lucian,
anxious to make the examination as exhaustive as
possible.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Denzil," answered Rhoda, after some
thought, "I can't, except that Mr. Wrent, long before
Christmas, promised me a present, and gave
me the cloak then."</p>

<p>"Will you let me take this cloak away with me?"</p>

<p>"If you like," replied Rhoda carelessly. "I
don't want it.'</p>

<p>"Oh, Rhoda!" wailed Mrs. Bensusan. "Your
lovely, lovely rabbit skin!"</p>

<p>"I'll bring it back again," said Lucian hastily.
"I only want to use it as evidence."</p>

<p>"Ye want to know who the lady is?" said Rhoda
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"No; but you'll find out from that cloak. I guess
why you're taking it."</p>

<p>"You are very sharp, Rhoda," said Lucian, rising,
with a good-humoured smile, "and well deserve
your local reputation. If I find Mr. Wrent, I may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>require you to identify him; and Mrs. Bensusan
also."</p>

<p>"I'll be able to do that, but missus hasn't her
eyes much."</p>

<p>"Hasn't her eyes?" repeated Denzil, with a
glance at Mrs. Bensusan's staring orbs.</p>

<p>"Lawks, sir, I'm shortsighted, though I never
lets on. Rhoda, 'ow can you 'ave let on to the gentleman
as I'm deficient? As to knowing Mr. Wrent,
I'd do so well enough," said Mrs. Bensusan, tossing
her head, "with his long white beard and white
'ead, let alone his black velvet skull-cap."</p>

<p>"Oh, he wore a skull-cap?"</p>

<p>"Only indoors," said Rhoda sharply, "but here
I'm 'olding the door wide, sir, so if you've done,
we're done."</p>

<p>"I'm done, as you call it, for the present," replied
Denzil, putting on his hat, "but I may come
again. In the meantime, hold your tongues. Silence
on this occasion will be gold; speech won't
even be silver."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensusan laughed at this speech in a fat
and comfortable sort of way, while Rhoda grinned,
and escorted Lucian to the front door. She looked
so uncanny, with her red hair and black eyes, that
the barrister could not forbear a question.</p>

<p>"Are you English, my girl?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't!" retorted Rhoda emphatically.
"I'm of the gentle Romany."</p>

<p>"A gipsy!"</p>

<p>"So you Gorgios call us!" replied the girl, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>shut the door with what seemed to be unnecessary
violence. Lucian went off with the cloak over his
arm, somewhat discomposed by this last piece of
information.</p>

<p>"A gipsy!" he repeated. "Humph! Can good
come out of Nazareth? I don't trust that girl
much. If I knew why she hates Wrent, I'd be much
more satisfied with her information. And who the
deuce is Wrent?"</p>

<p>Lucian had occasion to ask himself this question
many times before he found its answer, and that
was not until afterwards. At the present moment
he dismissed it from his mind as unprofitable. He
was too busy reflecting on the evidence obtained in
Jersey Street to waste time in conjecturing further
events. On returning to his lodgings he sat down
to consider what was best to be done.</p>

<p>After much reflection and internal argument, he
decided to call upon Mrs. Vrain, and by producing
the cloak, force her into confessing her share of
the crime. Whether she had been the principal
in the deed, or an accessory before the fact, Lucian
could not determine; but he was confident that in
one way or another she was cognizant of the truth;
although this she would probably conceal, as its
revelation would likely be detrimental to her own
safety.</p>

<p>At first Denzil intended to see Diana before visiting
Mrs. Vrain, in order to relate all he had
learned, and find out from her if the cloak really
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>belonged to the widow. But on second thoughts
he decided not to do so.</p>

<p>"I can tell her nothing absolutely certain about
the matter," he said to himself, "as I cannot be
sure of anything until I force Mrs. Vrain to confess.
Diana," so he called her in his discourse to
himself, "Diana will probably know nothing about
the ownership of the cloak, as it seems new, and
was probably purchased by Lydia during the absence
of Diana in Australia. No, I have the address
of Mrs. Vrain, which Diana gave me. It will
be best to call on her, and by displaying the cloak
make her acknowledge her guilt.</p>

<p>"With such evidence she cannot deny that she
visited Wrent; and was in the vicinity of the house
wherein her husband was murdered on the very
night the crime was committed. Also she must
state Ferruci's reason for hiding in the back yard,
and tell me plainly who Wrent is, and why he
helped the pair of them in their devilish plans. I
am doubtful if she will speak; but altogether the
evidence I have collected inculpates her so strongly
that it will be quite sufficient grounds upon which
to obtain a warrant for her arrest. And sooner
than risk that, I expect she will tell as much as
she can to exculpate herself&mdash;that is, if she is really
innocent. If she is guilty," Lucian shrugged his
shoulders, "then I cannot guess what course she
will take."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vrain, with her father to protect her, had
established herself in a small but luxurious house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>in Mayfair, and was preparing to enjoy herself during
the coming season. Although her husband had
met with a terrible death scarcely six months before,
she had already cast off her heavy mourning,
and wore only such millinery indications of sorrow
as suited with her widowed existence.</p>

<p>Ferruci was a constant visitor at the house; but
although Lydia was now free, and wealthy, she by
no means seemed ready to marry the Italian. Perhaps
she thought, with her looks and riches, she
might gain an English title, as more valuable than
a Continental one; and in this view she was supported
by her father. Clyne had no other desire
than to see his beloved Lydia happy, and would
willingly have sacrificed everything in his power to
gain such an end; but as he did not like Ferruci
himself, and saw that Lydia's affections towards
him had cooled greatly, he did not encourage the
idea of a match between them.</p>

<p>However, these matters were yet in abeyance,
as Lydia was too diplomatic to break off with so
subtle a man as the Count, who might prove a
dangerous enemy were his love turned to hate, and
Mr. Clyne was quite willing to remain on friendly
terms with the man so long as Lydia chose that
such friendship should exist. In short, Lydia ruled
her simple father with a rod of iron, and coaxed
Ferruci&mdash;a more difficult man to deal with&mdash;into
good humour; so she managed both of them skilfully
in every way, and contrived to keep things
smooth, pending her plunge into London society.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>For all her childish looks, Lydia was uncommonly
clever.</p>

<p>When Lucian's card was brought in, Mrs. Vrain
proved to be at home, and as his good looks had
made a deep impression on her, she received him at
once. He was shown into a luxuriously furnished
drawing-room without delay, and welcomed by
pretty Mrs. Vrain herself, who came forward with
a bright smile and outstretched hands, looking more
charming than ever.</p>

<p>"Well, I do call this real sweet of you," said
she gaily. "I guess it is about time you showed
up. But you don't look well, that's a fact. What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I'm worried a little," replied Lucian, confounded
by her coolness.</p>

<p>"That's no use, Mr. Denzil. You should never
be worried. I guess I don't let anything put me
out."</p>

<p>"Not even your husband's death?"</p>

<p>"That's rude!" said Lydia sharply, the colour
leaving her cheek. "What do you mean? Have
you come to be nasty?"</p>

<p>"I came to return you this," said Denzil, throwing
the cloak which he had carried on his arm before
the widow.</p>

<p>"This?" echoed Mrs. Vrain, looking at it.
"Well, what's this old thing got to do with me?"</p>

<p>"It's yours; you left it in Jersey Street!"</p>

<p>"Did I? And where's Jersey Street?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough," said Lucian sternly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>"It is near the place where your husband was murdered."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vrain turned white. "Do you dare to
say&mdash;&mdash;" she began, when Denzil cut her short
with a hint at her former discomposure.</p>

<p>"The stiletto, Mrs. Vrain! Don't forget the
stiletto!"</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" cried Lydia, trembling violently.
"What do you know of the stiletto?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A DENIAL</h3>


<p>"What do you know of the stiletto?" repeated
Mrs. Vrain anxiously.</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet, and, with an effort to
be calm, was holding on to the near chair. Her
bright colour had faded to a dull white hue, and
her eyes had a look of horror in their depths which
transformed her from her childish beauty into a
much older and more haggard woman than she
really was. It seemed as though Lucian, by some
necromantic spell, had robbed her of youth, vitality,
and careless happiness. To him this extraordinary
agitation was a proof of her guilt; and hardening
his heart so as not to spare her one iota of her
penalty&mdash;a mercy she did not deserve&mdash;he addressed
her sternly:</p>

<p>"I know that a stiletto purchased in Florence by
your late husband hung on the library wall of Berwin
Manor. I know that it is gone!"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" said Lydia, moistening her white,
dry lips, "it is gone; but I do not know who took
it."</p>

<p>"The person who killed your husband."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p><p>"I feared as much," she muttered, sitting down
again. "Do you know the name of the person?"</p>

<p>"As well as you do yourself. The name is Lydia
Vrain!"</p>

<p>"I!" She threw herself back on the chair with
a look of profound astonishment on her colourless
face. "Mr. Denzil," she stammered, "is&mdash;is this&mdash;is
this a jest?"</p>

<p>"You will not find it so, Mrs. Vrain."</p>

<p>The little woman clutched the arms of her chair
and leaned forward with her face no longer pale,
but red with rage and indignation. "If you are a
gentleman, Mr. Denzil, I guess you won't keep me
hanging on like this. Let us get level. Do you
say I killed Mark?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" said Lucian defiantly. "I am sure
of it."</p>

<p>"On what grounds?" asked Mrs. Vrain, holding
her temper back with a visible effort, that made her
eyes glitter and her breath short.</p>

<p>"On the grounds that he was killed with that
stiletto and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go slow! How do you know he was killed
with that stiletto?"</p>

<p>"Because the ribbon which attached it to the wall
was found in the Geneva Square house, where your
husband was killed. Miss Vrain recognised it."</p>

<p>"Miss Vrain&mdash;Diana! Is she in England?"</p>

<p>"Not only in England, but in London."</p>

<p>"Then why hasn't she been to see me?"</p>

<p>Denzil did not like to answer this question, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>more so as Lydia's sudden divergence from the
point of discourse rather disconcerted him. It is
impossible to maintain dignity in making a serious
accusation when the person against whom it is made
thinks so little of it as to turn aside to discuss a
point of etiquette in connection with another
woman.</p>

<p>Seeing that her accuser was silent and confused,
Lydia recovered her tongue and colour, and the
equability of her temper. It was, therefore, with
some raillery that she continued her speech:</p>

<p>"I see how it is," she said contemptuously, "Diana
has called you into her councils in order to fix
this absurd charge on to me. Afraid to come herself,
she sends you as the braver person of the partnership.
I congratulate you on your errand, Mr.
Denzil."</p>

<p>"You can laugh as much as you like, Mrs. Vrain,
but the matter is more serious than you suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure that my loving stepdaughter will
make it as serious as possible. She always hated
me."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mrs. Vrain," said Lucian, colouring
with annoyance, "but I did not come here to
hear you speak ill of Miss Vrain."</p>

<p>"I know that! She sent you here to speak ill <i>of</i>
me and do ill <i>to</i> me. Well, so you and she accuse
me of killing Mark? I shall be glad to hear the
evidence you can bring forward. If you can make
your charge good I should smile. Oh, I guess
so!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>Denzil noticed that when Mrs. Vrain became excited
she usually spoke plain English, without the
U. S. A. accent, but on growing calmer, and, as it
were, recollecting herself, she adopted the Yankee
twang and their curious style of expression and ejaculation.
This led him to suspect that the fair Lydia
was not a born daughter of the Great Republic,
perhaps not even a naturalised citizeness, but had
assumed such nationality as one attractive to society
in Europe and Great Britain.</p>

<p>He wondered what her past really was, and if
she and her father were the doubtful adventurers
Diana believed them to be. If so, it might happen
that Lydia would extricate herself out of her present
unpleasant position by the use of past experience.
To give her no chance of such dodging, Lucian
rapidly detailed the evidence against her so
that she would be hard put to baffle it. But in
this estimate he quite underrated Lydia's nerve and
capability of fence, let alone the dexterity with
which she produced a satisfactory reply to each of
his questions.</p>

<p>"We will begin at the beginning, Mrs. Vrain,"
he said soberly, "say from the time you drove your
unfortunate husband out of his own house."</p>

<p>"Now, I guess that wasn't my fault," explained
Lydia. "I wasn't in love with old man Mark, but
I liked him well enough, for he was a real gentleman;
and when that make-mischief Diana, who
cocked her nose at me, set out for Australia, we
got on surprisingly well. Count Ferruci came over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>to stay, as much at Mark's invitation as mine, and
I didn't pay too much attention to him anyhow."</p>

<p>"Miss Tyler says you did!"</p>

<p>"Sakes!" cried Mrs. Vrain, raising her eyebrows,
"have you been talking to that old stump? Well,
just you look here, Mr. Denzil! It was Bella
Tyler who made all the mischief. She thought
Ercole was sweet on her, and when she found out
he wasn't, she got real mad, and went to tell Mark
that I was making things hum the wrong way with
the Count. Of course Mark had a row with him,
and, of course, I got riz&mdash;not having done anything
to lie low for. We had a row royal, I guess, and
the end of it was that Mark cleared out. I thought
he would turn up again, or apply for a divorce,
though he hadn't any reason to. But he did neither,
and remained away for a whole year. While he
was away I got quit of Ercole pretty smart, I can
tell you, as I wanted to shut up that old maid's
mouth. I never knew where Mark was, or guessed
what became of him, until I saw that advertisement,
and putting two and two together to make
four, I called to see Mr. Link, where I found you
running the circus."</p>

<p>"Why did you faint on the mention of the stiletto?"</p>

<p>"I told you the reason, and Link also."</p>

<p>"Yes, but your reason was too weak to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you're right enough there," interrupted
Lydia, smiling. "All that talk of nerves and
grief wasn't true. I didn't give my real reason,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>but I will now. When I heard that the old man
had been stabbed by a stiletto I remembered that
the one on the library wall had vanished some time
before the Christmas Eve on which Mark was
killed. So you may guess I was afraid."</p>

<p>"For yourself?"</p>

<p>"I guess not; it wasn't any of my funeral. I
didn't take the stiletto, nor did I know who had;
but I was afraid you might think Ferruci took it.
The stiletto was Italian, and the Count is Italian,
so it struck me you might put two and two together
and suspect Ercole. I never thought you'd fix on
me," concluded Lydia, with a scornful toss of her
head.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I fixed on you both," said
Lucian composedly.</p>

<p>"And for what reason? Why should I and the
Count murder poor Mark, if you please? He was
a fool and a bore, but I wished him no harm. I
was sorry as any one when I heard of his death,
and I offered a good reward for the catching of
the mean skunk that killed him. If I had done so
myself I wouldn't have been such a fool as to
sharpen the scent of the hounds on my own trail."</p>

<p>"You were in town on Christmas Eve?" said
Denzil, not choosing to explain the motives he believed
the pair had for committing the crime.</p>

<p>"I was. What of that?"</p>

<p>"You were in Jersey Street, Pimlico, on that
night."</p>

<p>"I was never in Pimlico in my life!" declared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>Lydia wrathfully, "and, as I said before, I don't
know where Jersey Street is."</p>

<p>"Do you know a man called Wrent?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of him!"</p>

<p>"Yet you visited him in Jersey Street on Christmas
Eve, between seven and eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Did I, really?" cried Mrs. Vrain, ironically,
"and how can you prove I did?"</p>

<p>"By that cloak," said Lucian, pointing to where
it lay on a chair. "You wore that cloak and a velvet-spotted
veil."</p>

<p>"I haven't worn a veil of that kind for over a
year," said Lydia decisively, "though I admit I used
to wear veils of that sort. You can ask my maid
if I have any velvet-spotted veils in my wardrobe
just now. As to the cloak&mdash;I never wear rabbit
skins."</p>

<p>"You might as a disguise."</p>

<p>"Sakes alive, man, what should I want with a
disguise? I tell you the cloak isn't mine. You
can soon prove that. Find out who made it, and go
and ask in the shop if I bought it."</p>

<p>"How can I find out who made it?" asked Denzil,
who was beginning to feel that Lydia was one
too many for him.</p>

<p>"Here! I'll show you!" said Lydia, and picking
up the cloak she turned over the tab at the neck,
by which it was hung up. At the back of this there
was a small piece of tape with printed black letters.
"Baxter &amp; Co., General Drapers, Bayswater," she
read out, throwing down the cloak contemptuously.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>"I don't go to a London suburb for my frocks; I
get them in Paris."</p>

<p>"Then you are sure this cloak isn't yours?" asked
Lucian, much perplexed.</p>

<p>"No! I tell you it isn't! Go and ask Baxter
&amp; Co. if I bought it. I'll go with you, if you like;
or better still," cried Mrs. Vrain, jumping up briskly,
"I can take you to see some friends with whom
I stayed on Christmas Eve. The whole lot will
tell you that I was with them at Camden Hill all
the night."</p>

<p>"What! Can you prove an alibi?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you call it," retorted Lydia
coolly, "but I can prove pretty slick that I wasn't
in Pimlico."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Mrs. Vrain&mdash;your friend&mdash;Ferruci was
there!"</p>

<p>"Was he? Well, I don't know. I never saw
him that time he was in town. But if you think
he killed Mark you are wrong. I do not believe
Ercole would kill a fly, for all he's an Italian."</p>

<p>"Do you think he took that stiletto?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't!"</p>

<p>"Then who did?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't even know when it was
taken. I missed it after Christmas, because that old
schoolma'am told me it was gone."</p>

<p>"Old schoolma'am!"</p>

<p>"Well, Bella Tyler, if you like that better," retorted
Mrs. Vrain. "Come, now, Mr. Denzil, I'm
not going to let you go away without proving my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>&mdash;what
do you call it?&mdash;alibi. Come with me right
along to Camden Hill."</p>

<p>"I'll come just to satisfy myself," said Lucian,
picking up the cloak, "but I am beginning to feel
that it is unnecessary."</p>

<p>"You think I am innocent? Well," drawled
Lydia, as Lucian nodded, "I think that's real sweet
of you. I mayn't be a saint, but I'm not quite the
sinner that Diana of yours makes me out."</p>

<p>"Diana of mine, Mrs. Vrain?" said Lucian, colouring.</p>

<p>The little woman laughed at his blush.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not a fool, young man. I see how
the wind blows!" And with a nod she vanished.</p>

<h3>WHO BOUGHT THE CLOAK?</h3>


<p>Mrs. Vrain sacrificed the vanity of a lengthy
toilette to a natural anxiety to set herself right with
Lucian, and appeared shortly in a ravishing costume
fresh from Paris. Perhaps by arraying herself so
smartly she wished to assure Denzil more particularly
that she was a lady of too much taste to buy
rabbit-skin cloaks in Bayswater: or perhaps&mdash;which
was more probable&mdash;she was not averse to ensnaring
so handsome a young man into an innocent flirtation.</p>

<p>The suspicion she entertained of Lucian's love
for Diana only made Lydia the more eager to fascinate
him on her own account. A conceit of herself,
a hatred of her stepdaughter, and a desire to
wring admiration out of a man who did not wish
to bestow it. These were the reasons which led
Mrs. Vrain to be particularly agreeable to the barrister.
When the pair were ensconced in a swift
hansom, and rolling rapidly towards Camden Hill,
she began at once to prosecute her amiable designs.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll not mind being my best boy for
the day," she said, with a coquettish glance. "You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>can escort me, first of all, to the Pegalls, and afterwards
we can drive to Baxter &amp; Co.'s in Bayswater,
so that you can assure yourself I didn't buy
that cloak."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged for the trouble you are taking,
Mrs. Vrain," replied the young man, avoiding
with some reserve the insinuating glances of his
pretty companion. "We shall do as you suggest.
Who are the Pegalls, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"My friends, with whom I stopped on Christmas
Eve," rejoined Mrs. Vrain. "A real good, old,
dull English family, as heavy as their own plum
puddings. Mrs. Pegall's a widow like myself, and
I daresay she buys her frocks in the Bayswater
stores. She has two daughters who look like barmaids,
and ought to be, only they ain't smart
enough. We had a real Sunday at home on Christmas
Eve, Mr. Denzil. Whist and weak tea at
eight, negus and prayers and bed at ten. Poppa
wanted to teach them poker, and they kicked like
mad at the very idea; but that was when he visited
them before, I guess."</p>

<p>"Not the kind of family likely to suit you, I
should think," said Lucian, regarding the little free-lance
with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>"I guess not. Lead's a feather to them for
weight. But it's a good thing to have respectable
friends, especially in this slow coach of an old country,
where you size everybody up by the company
they keep."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lucian pointedly and&mdash;it must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>confessed&mdash;rather rudely, "so you have found the
necessity of having respectable friends, however
dull?"</p>

<p>"That's a fact," acknowledged Mrs. Vrain candidly.
"I've had a queer sort of life with poppa&mdash;ups
and downs, and flyings over the moon, I guess."</p>

<p>"You are not American?" said Denzil suddenly.</p>

<p>"Sakes! How do you figure that out?"</p>

<p>"Because you are too pronouncedly Amurrican
to be American."</p>

<p>"That's an epigram with some truth in it," replied
Lydia coolly. "Oh, I'm as much a U. S. A.
article as anything else. We hung out our shingle
in Wyoming, Wis., for a considerable time, and
a girl who tickets herself Yankee this side flies high.
But I guess I'm not going to give you my history,"
concluded Mrs. Vrain drily. "I'm not a Popey nor
you a confessor."</p>

<p>"H'm! You've been in the South Seas, I see."</p>

<p>"There's no telling. How do you know?"</p>

<p>"The natives there use the word Popey to designate
a Roman Catholic."</p>

<p>"You are as smart as they make 'em, Mr. Denzil.
There's no flies about you; but I'm not going to give
myself away. Ask poppa, if you want information.
He's that simple he'll tell you all."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Vrain, keep your own secret; it is
not the one I wish to discover. By the way, you
say your father was at Camden Hill on Christmas
Eve?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say so, but he was," answered Lydia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>quietly. "He was not very well&mdash;pop can't stand
these English winters&mdash;and wrote me to come up.
But he was so sick that he left the Pegalls' about
six o'clock."</p>

<p>"That was the letter which upset you."</p>

<p>"It was. I see old Bella Tyler kept her eyes
peeled. I got the letter and came up at once. I've
only got one parent left, and he's too good to be
shoved away in a box underground while fools live.
But here we are at the Pegalls'. I hope you'll
like the kind of circus they run. Campmeetings
are nothing to it."</p>

<p>The dwelling of the respectable family alluded
to was a tolerably sized house of red brick, placed
in a painfully neat garden, and shut in from the
high road by a tall and jealous fence of green-painted
wood. The stout widow and two stout
spinster daughters, who made up the inmates, quite
deserved Mrs. Vrain's epithet of "heavy." They
were aggressively healthy, with red cheeks, black
hair, and staring black eyes devoid of expression;
a trio of Dutch dolls would have looked more intellectual.
They were plainly and comfortably dressed;
the drawing-room was plainly and comfortably furnished;
and both house and inmates looked thoroughly
respectable and eminently dull. What such
a hawk as Mrs. Vrain was doing in this Philistine
dove-cote, Lucian could not conjecture; but he
admired her tact in making friends with a family
whose heavy gentility assisted to ballast her somewhat
light reputation; while the three of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>brains in unison could not comprehend her tricks,
or the reasons for which they were played.</p>

<p>"At all events, these three women are too honest
to speak anything but the truth," thought Lucian
while undergoing the ordeal of being presented.
"So I'll learn for certain if Mrs. Vrain was really
here on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>The Misses Pegall and their lace-capped mamma
welcomed Lucian with heavy good nature and much
simpering, for they also had an eye to a comely
young man; but the cunning Lydia they kissed and
embraced, and called "dear" with much zeal. Mrs.
Vrain, on her part, darted from one to the other
like a bird, pecking the red apples of their cheeks,
and cast an arch glance at Lucian to see if he admired
her talent for man&#339;uvering. Then cake and
wine, port and sherry, were produced in the style
of early Victorian hospitality, from which epoch
Mrs. Pegall dated, and all went merry as a marriage
bell, while Lydia laid her plans to have herself
exculpated in Lucian's eyes without being inculpated
in those of the family.</p>

<p>"We have just come up from our place in Somerset,"
explained Mrs. Pegall, in a comfortable
voice. "The girls wanted to see the sights, so I
just said, 'we'll go, dears, and perhaps we'll get
a glimpse of the dear Queen.' I'm sure she has no
more loyal subjects than we three."</p>

<p>"Are you going out much this year, dear Mrs.
Vrain?" asked Beatrice Pegall, the elder and plainer
of the sisters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p><p>"No, dear," replied Lydia, with a sigh, putting
a dainty handkerchief to her eyes. "You know
what I have lost."</p>

<p>The two groaned, and Miss Cecilia Pegall, who
was by way of being very religious in a Low Church
way, remarked that "all flesh was grass," to which
observation her excellent mamma rejoined: "Very
true, dear, very true." And then the trio sighed
again, and shook their black heads like so many
mandarins.</p>

<p>"I should never support my grief," continued
Lydia, still tearful, "if it was not that I have at
least three dear friends. Ah! I shall never forget
that happy Christmas Eve!"</p>

<p>"Last Christmas Eve, dear Mrs. Vrain?" said
Cecilia.</p>

<p>"When you were all so kind and good," sobbed
Lydia, with a glance at Lucian, to see that he noticed
the confirmation. "We played whist, didn't
we?"</p>

<p>"Four rubbers," groaned Mrs. Pegall, "and retired
to bed at ten o'clock, after prayers and a short
hymn. Quite a carol that hymn was, eh, dears?"</p>

<p>"And your poor pa was so bad with his cough,"
said Beatrice, "I hope it is better. He went away
before dinner, too! Do say your pa is better!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, much better," said Lydia, and considering
it was four months since Christmas Eve,
Lucian thought it was time Mr. Clyne recovered.</p>

<p>"He enjoyed his tea, though," said Cecilia. "Mr.
Clyne always says there is no tea like ours."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p><p>"And no evenings," cried Lydia, who was very
glad there were not. "Poppa and I are coming
soon to have a long evening&mdash;to play whist again."</p>

<p>"But, dear Mrs. Vrain, you are not going?"</p>

<p>"I must, dears," with a kiss all round. "I have
such a lot to do, and Mr. Denzil is coming with me,
as poppa wants to consult him about some law business.
He's a barrister, you know."</p>

<p>"I hope Mr. Denzil will come and see us again,"
said Mrs. Pegall, shaking hands with Lucian. A
fat, puffy hand she had, and damp.</p>

<p>"Oh, delighted! delighted!" said Denzil hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Cards and tea, and sensible conversation," said
Beatrice seriously, "no more."</p>

<p>"You forget prayers at ten, dear," rejoined Cecilia
in low tones.</p>

<p>"We are a plain family, Mr. Denzil. You must
take us as we are."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Pegall, I will."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dears," cried Lydia again, and with
a final peck all round she skipped out and into the
hansom, followed by her escort.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said Mrs. Vrain, when the cab drove
away in the direction of Bayswater. "Oh, don't
look so shocked, Mr. Denzil. I assure you I am
not in the habit of swearing, but the extreme respectability
of the Pegalls always makes me wish to
relieve my feelings by going to the other extreme.
What do you think of them?"</p>

<p>"They seem very good people, and genuine."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p><p>"And very genteel and dull," retorted Lydia.
"Like Washington, they can't tell a lie for a red
cent; so you can believe I was there with poppa on
Christmas Eve, only he went away, and I stayed all
night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it, Mrs. Vrain."</p>

<p>"Then I couldn't have been in Jersey Street or
Geneva Square, sticking Mark with the stiletto?"</p>

<p>"No! I believe you to be innocent," said Lucian
gravely. "In fact, I really don't think it is necessary
to find out about this cloak at Baxter &amp; Co.'s.
I am assured you did not buy it."</p>

<p>"I guess I didn't, Mr. Denzil; but you want to
know who did, and so do I. Well, you need not
open your eyes. I'd like to know who killed Mark,
also; and you say that cloak will show it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that; but the cloak may identify
the woman I wrongfully took for you. She may
have to do with the matter."</p>

<p>Lydia shook her pretty head. "Not she. Mark
was as respectable as the Pegall gang; there's no
woman mixed up in this matter."</p>

<p>"But I saw the shadow of a woman on the blind
of No. 13!"</p>

<p>"You don't say! In Mark's sitting-room? Well,
I should smile to know he was human, after all. He
was always so precious stiff!"</p>

<p>Something in Mrs. Vrain's light talk of her dead
husband jarred on the feelings of Lucian, and in
some displeasure he held his peace. In no wise
abashed, Lydia feigned to take no notice of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>tacit reproof, but chatted on about all and everything
in the most frivolous manner. Not until they
had entered the shop of Baxter &amp; Co. did she resume
attention to business.</p>

<p>"Here," she said to the smiling shopwalker, "I
want to know by whom this cloak was sold, and to
what person."</p>

<p>The man examined the cloak, and noted a private
mark on it, which evidently afforded him some information
not obtainable by the general public, for
he guided Lucian and his companion to a counter
behind which stood a brisk woman with sharp eyes.
In her turn she also examined the cloak, and departed
to refresh her memory by looking at some account
book. When she returned it was to intimate
that the cloak had been bought by a man.</p>

<p>"A man!" repeated Lucian, much astonished.
"What was he like?"</p>

<p>"A dark man," replied the brisk shopwoman,
"dark hair, dark eyes, and a dark moustache. I
remember him well, because he was a foreigner."</p>

<p>"A foreigner?" repeated Lydia in her turn. "A
Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"No, madam&mdash;an Italian. He told me as much."</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" cried Mrs. Vrain. "You are
right, Mr. Denzil. It's Ferruci sure enough!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE DEFENCE OF COUNT FERRUCI</h3>


<p>"It is quite impossible!" cried Mrs. Vrain distractedly.
"I can't believe it nohow!"</p>

<p>The little woman was back again in her own
drawing-room, talking to Lucian about the discovery
which had lately been made regarding Ferruci's
purchase of the cloak. Mrs. Vrain having proved
her own innocence by the evidence of the Pegall
family, was now trying to persuade both herself
and Denzil that the Count could not be possibly
implicated in the matter. He had no motive to
kill Vrain, she said, a statement with which Lucian
at once disagreed.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Vrain, he had two motives,"
said the barrister quickly. "In the first
place, he was in love, and wished to marry you; in
the second, he was poor, and wanted money. By
the death of your husband he hoped to gain both."</p>

<p>"He has gained neither, as yet," replied Lydia
sharply. "I like Ercole well enough, and at one
time I was almost engaged to him. But he has a
nasty temper of his own, Mr. Denzil, so I shunted
him pretty smart to marry Mark Vrain. I wouldn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>marry him now if he dumped down a million dollars
at my feet to-morrow. Besides, poppa don't
like him at all. I've got my money, and I've got
my freedom, and I don't fool away either the one
or the other on that Italian dude!"</p>

<p>"Is the Count acquainted with these sentiments?"
asked Lucian drily.</p>

<p>"I guess so, Mr. Denzil. He asked me to marry
him two months after Mark's death, and I just up
and told him pretty plain how the cat jumped."</p>

<p>"In plain English, you refused him?"</p>

<p>"You bet I did!" cried Lydia vigorously. "So
you see, Mr. Denzil, he could not have killed
Mark."</p>

<p>"Why not? He did not know your true mind
until two months after the murder."</p>

<p>"That's a fact, anyhow," commented Mrs.
Vrain. "But what the mischief made him buy that
rabbit-skin cloak?"</p>

<p>"I expect he bought it for the woman I mistook
for you."</p>

<p>"And who may she be?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I wish to find out. This
woman who came to Jersey Street so often wore this
cloak; therefore, she must have obtained it from
the Count. I'll make him tell me who she is, and
what she has to do with this crime."</p>

<p>"Do you think she has anything to do with it?"
said Mrs. Vrain doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I am certain. It must have been her shadow I
saw on the blind."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p><p>"And the man's shadow was the Count's?" questioned
Lydia.</p>

<p>"I think so. He bought the cloak for the woman,
visited the man Wrent at Jersey Street, and was
seen by the servant in the back yard. He did not
act thus without some object, Mrs. Vrain, you may
be sure of that."</p>

<p>"Sakes!" said Lydia, with a weary sigh. "I ain't
sure of anything save that my head is buzzing like
a sawmill. Who is Wrent, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. An old man with white beard
and a skull-cap of black velvet."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Mrs. Vrain, with a shiver. "Mark
used to wear a black skull-cap, and the thought of
it makes me freeze up. Sounds like a judge of
your courts ordering a man to be lynched. Well,
Mr. Denzil, it seems to me as you'd best hustle
Ercole. If he knows who the woman is&mdash;and he
wouldn't buy cloaks for her if he didn't&mdash;he'll know
who this Wrent is. I guess he can supply all information."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"Number 40, Marquis Street, St. James's. You
go and look him up, while I tell poppa what a mean
white he is. I guess poppa won't let him come near
me again. Pop's an honest man, though he ain't no
Washington."</p>

<p>"Suppose I find out that he killed your husband?"
asked Lucian, rising.</p>

<p>"Then you'd best lynch him right away," re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>plied
Lydia without hesitation. "I draw the line
at murder&mdash;some!"</p>

<p>The barrister was somewhat disgusted to hear
Mrs. Vrain so coolly devote her whilom admirer to
a shameful death. However, he knew that her
heart was hard and her nature selfish; so there was
little use in showing any outward displeasure at her
want of charity. She had cleared herself from suspicion,
and evidently cared not who suffered, so long
as she was safe and well spoken of. Moreover,
Lucian had learned all he wished about her movements
on the night of the crime, and taking a hasty
leave, he went off to Marquis Street for the purpose
of bringing Ferruci to book for his share in the terrible
business. However, the Count proved to be
from home, and would not be back, so the servant
said, until late that night.</p>

<p>Denzil therefore left a message that he would
call at noon the next day, and drove from St.
James's to Kensington, where he visited Diana.
Here he detailed what he had learned and done
from the time he had visited Mrs. Bensusan up to
the interview with Lydia. Also he displayed the
cloak, and narrated how Mrs. Vrain had cleared
herself of its purchase.</p>

<p>To all this Diana listened with the greatest interest,
and when Lucian ended she looked at him
for some moments in silence. In fact, Diana, with
all her wit and common sense, did not know how
to regard the present position of affairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p><p>"Well, Miss Vrain," said Lucian, seeing that she
did not speak, "what do you think of it all?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vrain appears to be innocent," said Diana
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Assuredly she is! The evidence of the Pegall
family&mdash;given in all innocence&mdash;proves that she
could not have been in Geneva Square or in Jersey
Street on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>"Then we come back to my original belief, Mr.
Denzil. Lydia did not commit the crime herself,
but employed Ferruci to do so."</p>

<p>"No," replied Denzil decidedly. "Whether the
Italian is guilty or not, Mrs. Vrain knows nothing
about it. If she were cognisant of his guilt she
would not have risked going with me to Baxter &amp;
Co., and letting me discover that Ferruci had
bought the cloak. Nor would she so lightly surrender
a possible accomplice as she has done Ferruci.
Whatever can be said of Mrs. Vrain's conduct&mdash;and
I admit that it is far from perfect&mdash;yet
I must say that she appears, by the strongest
evidence, to be totally innocent and ignorant. She
knows no more about the matter than her father
does."</p>

<p>"Well," said Diana, unwilling to grant her stepmother
too much grace, "we must give her the benefit
of the doubt. What about Ferruci?"</p>

<p>"So far as I can see, Ferruci is guilty," replied
Lucian. "To clear himself he will have to give
the same proof as Mrs. Vrain. Firstly, he will
have to show that he was not in Jersey Street on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Christmas Eve; secondly, he will have to prove that
he did not buy the cloak. But in the face of the
servant's evidence, and the statement of the shopwoman,
he will find it difficult to clear himself.
Yet," added Lucian, remembering his failure with
Lydia, "it is always possible that he may do so."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Mr. Denzil, that your only
chance of getting at the truth is to see the Italian."</p>

<p>"I think so myself. I will see him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Will you take Mr. Link with you?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Vrain. As I have found out so much
without Link, I may as well proceed in the matter
until his professional services are required to arrest
Count Ferruci. By the way, I have never seen
that gentleman. Can you describe his appearance
to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as far as looks go there is no fault to be
found with him," answered Diana. "He is a typical
Italian, tall, slender, and olive complexioned.
He speaks English very well, indeed, and appears
to be possessed of considerable education. Certainly,
to look at him, and to speak with him, you would
not think he was a villain likely to murder a defenceless
old man. But if he did not kill my poor
father, I know not who did."</p>

<p>"I'll call on him to-morrow at noon," said Lucian,
"and later on I shall come here to tell you what
has passed between us."</p>

<p>This remark brought the business between them
to a close, but Lucian would fain have lingered to
engage Diana in lighter conversation. Miss Vrain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>however, was too much disturbed by the news he
had brought her to indulge in frivolous talk. Her
mind, busied with recollections of her deceased
father, and anxiously seeking some means whereby
to avenge his death, was ill attuned to encourage
at the moment the aspirations which she knew
Lucian entertained.</p>

<p>The barrister, therefore, sighed and hinted in
vain. His Dulcinea would have none of him or
his courting, and he was compelled to retire, as
disconsolate a lover as could be seen. To slightly
alter the saying of Shakespeare, "the course of true
love never does run smooth," but there were surely
an unusual number of obstacles in the current of
Denzil's desires. But as he consoled himself with
reflecting that the greater the prize the harder it
is to win, so it behooved him to do his devoir like
a true knight.</p>

<p>The next day, at noon, Lucian, armed for the
encounter with the evidence of Rhoda and of the
cloak, presented himself at the rooms which Count
Ferruci temporarily inhabited in Marquis Street.
He not only found the Italian ready to receive him,
but in full possession of the adventure of the cloak,
which, as he admitted, he had learned from Lydia
the previous evening. Also, Count Ferruci was
extremely indignant, and informed Lucian that he
was easily able to clear himself of the suspicion.
While he raged on in his fiery Italian way, Denzil,
who saw no chance of staying the torrent of words,
examined him at his leisure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p><p>Ercole Ferruci was, as Diana had said, a singularly
handsome man of thirty-five. He was dark,
slender, and tall, with dark, flashing eyes, a heavy
black moustache, and an alert military look about
him which showed that he had served in the army.
The above description savours a trifle of the impossible
hero of a young lady's dream; and, as a
matter of fact, Ferruci was not unlike that ideal
personage. He had all the looks and graces which
women admire, and seemed honest and fiery enough
in a manly way&mdash;the last person, as Lucian thought,
to gain his aims by underhand ways, or to kill a
helpless old man. But Lucian, legally experienced
in human frailty, was not to be put off with voluble
conversation and outward graces. He wished for
proofs of innocence, and these he tried to obtain
as soon as Ferruci drew breath in his fiery harangue.</p>

<p>"If you are innocent, Count," said Lucian, in
reply to the fluent, incorrect English of the Italian,
"appearances are against you. However, you can
prove yourself innocent, if you will."</p>

<p>"Sir!" cried Ferruci, "is not my word good?"</p>

<p>"Not good enough for an English court," replied
Lucian coldly. "You say you were not in Jersey
Street on Christmas Eve. Who can prove that?"</p>

<p>"My friend&mdash;my dear friend, Dr. Jorce of
Hampstead, sir. I was with him; oh, yes, sir, he
will tell you so."</p>

<p>"Very good! I hope his evidence will clear you,"
replied the more phlegmatic Englishman. "And
this cloak?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p><p>"I never bought the cloak! I saw it not before!"</p>

<p>"Then come with me to the shop in Bayswater,
and hear what the girl who sold it says."</p>

<p>"I will come at once!" cried Ferruci hastily,
catching up his cane and hat. "Come, then, my
friend! Come! What does the woman say?"</p>

<p>"That she sold the cloak to a tall man&mdash;to a
dark man with a moustache, and one who told her
he was Italian."</p>

<p>"Bah!" retorted the Count, as they hailed a hansom.
"Is all that she can say? Why, all we Italians
are supposed to be tall and dark, and wear
moustaches. Your common people in England never
fancy one of us can be fair."</p>

<p>"You are not fair," replied Lucian drily, "and
your looks correspond to the description."</p>

<p>"True! Oh, yes, sir! But that description might
describe a dozen of my countrymen. And, Mr.
Denzil," added the Count, laughing, "I do not go
round about saying to common people that I am
an Italian. It is not my custom to explain."</p>

<p>Lucian shrugged his shoulders, and said no more
until they entered the shop in Bayswater. As he
knew from the previous visit where the saleswoman
was located, he led the Count rapidly to the place.
The girl was there, as brisk and businesslike as ever.
She looked up as they approached, and came forward
to serve them, with a swift glance at both.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to trouble you again," said Lucian
ceremoniously, "but you told me yesterday that you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>sold a blue cloak, lined with rabbit skin, to an Italian
gentleman, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And am I the gentleman?" interrupted Ferruci.
"Did I buy a cloak?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the shopwoman, after a sharp
glance. "This is not the gentleman who bought the
cloak."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A NEW DEVELOPMENT</h3>


<p>"You see, Mr. Denzil," said Ferruci, turning
triumphantly to Lucian, "I did not buy this cloak;
I am not the Italian this lady speaks of."</p>

<p>Lucian was extremely astonished at this unexpected
testimony in favour of the Count, and questioned
the shopwoman sharply. "Are you certain of what
you say?" he asked, looking at her intently.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, sir," replied the girl stiffly, as though
she did not like her word doubted. "The gentleman
who bought the cloak was not so tall as this
one, nor did he speak English well. I had great
difficulty in learning what he wanted."</p>

<p>"But you said that he was dark, with a moustache&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said all that, sir; but this is not the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Could you swear to it?" said Lucian, more chagrined
than he liked to show to the victorious
Ferruci.</p>

<p>"If it is necessary, I could, sir," said the shopwoman,
with the greatest confidence. And after so
direct a reply, and such certain evidence, Denzil had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>nothing to do but retire from an awkward position
as gracefully as he could.</p>

<p>"And now, sir," said Ferruci, who had followed
him out of the shop, "you come with me, please."</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked Lucian gloomily.</p>

<p>"To my friend&mdash;to my rooms. I have shown I
did not buy the cloak you speak of. Now we must
find my friend, Dr. Jorce, to tell you I was not
at Jersey Street when you say."</p>

<p>"Is Dr. Jorce at your rooms?"</p>

<p>"I asked him to call about this time," said Ferruci,
glancing at his watch. "When Mrs. Vrain
speak to me of what you say I wish to defend myself,
so I write last night to my friend to talk with
you this day. I get his telegram saying he would
come at two hours."</p>

<p>Lucian glanced in his turn at his watch. "Half-past
one," he said, beckoning to a cab. "Very good,
Count, we will just have time to get back to your
place."</p>

<p>"And what you think now?" said Ferruci, with a
malicious twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to think," replied Lucian
dismally, "save that it is a strange coincidence that
<i>another</i> Italian should have bought the cloak."</p>

<p>The Count shrugged his shoulders as they got
into the hansom, but he did not speak until they
were well on their way back to Marquis Street. He
then looked thoughtfully at his companion. "I do
not believe coincidence," he said abruptly, "but in
design."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p><p>"What do you mean, Count? I do not quite
follow you."</p>

<p>"Some one who knows I love Mrs. Vrain wish to
injure me," said the Italian rapidly, "and so make
theirself like me to buy that cloak. Ah! you see?
But he could not make himself as tall as me. Oh,
yes, sir, I am sure it is so."</p>

<p>"Do you know any one who would disguise himself
so as to implicate you in the murder?"</p>

<p>"No." Ferruci shook his head. "I cannot think
of one man&mdash;not one."</p>

<p>"Do you know a man called Wrent?" asked
Lucian abruptly.</p>

<p>"I do not, Mr. Denzil," said Ferruci at once.
"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought he might be the man to disguise
himself. But no," added Lucian, remembering
Rhoda's account of Wrent's white hair and
beard, "it cannot be him. He would not sacrifice
his beard to carry out the plan; in fact he could not
without attracting Rhoda's attention."</p>

<p>"Rhoda! Wrent! What strange names you
talk of!" cried Ferruci vivaciously.</p>

<p>"No stranger than that of your friend Jorce."</p>

<p>Ferruci laughed. "Oh, he is altogether most
strange. You see."</p>

<p>It was as the Italian said. Dr. Jorce&mdash;who was
waiting for them in the Count's room&mdash;proved to
be a small, dried-up atom of a man, who looked as
though all the colour had been bleached out of him.
At first sight he was more like a monkey than a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>man, owing to his slight, queer figure and agile
movements; but a closer examination revealed that
he had a clever face, and a pair of most remarkable
eyes. These were of a steel-grey hue, with an extraordinary
intensity of gaze; and when he fixed
them on Lucian at the moment of introduction the
young barrister felt as though he were being mesmerised.</p>

<p>For the rest, Jorce was dressed sombrely in black
cloth, was extremely voluble and vivacious, and impressed
Lucian with the idea that he was less a fellow
mortal than a changeling from fairyland. Quite
an exceptional man was Dr. Jorce, and, as the
Italian said, "most strange."</p>

<p>"My good friend," said Ferruci, laying his stern
hand on the shoulder of this oddity, "this gentleman
wishes you to decide a&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;bet?"</p>

<p>"A bet!" cried the little doctor in a deep bass
voice, but with some indignation. "Do I understand,
Count, that you have brought me all the way
from my place in Hampstead to decide a bet?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but sir, it is a bet most important," said
Ferruci, with a smile. "This Mr. Denzil declares
that he saw me in Pim&mdash;Pim&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"In Pimlico," said Lucian, seeing that Ferruci
could not pronounce the word. "I say that the
Count was in Pimlico on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, sir," said Jorce, with a wave
of his skinny hand. "My friend, Count Ferruci,
was in my house at Hampstead on that evening."</p>

<p>"Was he?" remarked Lucian, astonished at this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>confident assertion. "And at what time did he
leave?"</p>

<p>"He did not leave till next morning. My friend
the Count remained under my roof all night, and
left at twelve o'clock on Christmas morning."</p>

<p>"So you see," said Ferruci airily to Lucian, "that
I could not have done what you think, as that was
done&mdash;by what you said&mdash;between eleven and
twelve on that night."</p>

<p>"Was the Count with you at ten o'clock on that
evening?" asked Denzil.</p>

<p>"Certainly he was; so you have lost your bet,
Mr. Denzil. Sorry to bring you such bad fortune,
but truth is truth, you know."</p>

<p>"Would you repeat this statement, if I wished?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Call on me at any time. 'The
Haven, Hampstead'; that will always find me."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I do not think it will be necessary for
Mr. Denzil to call on you, sir," interposed the
Count rapidly. "You can always come to me. Well,
Mr. Denzil, are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied Lucian. "I have lost my bet,
Count, and I apologise. Good-day, Dr. Jorce, and
thank you. Count Ferruci, I wish you good-bye."</p>

<p>"Not even <i>au revoir</i>?" said Ferruci mockingly.</p>

<p>"That depends upon the future," replied Lucian
coolly, and forthwith went away in low spirits at
the downfall of his hopes. Far from revealing the
mystery of Vrain's death, his late attempts to solve
it had resulted in utter failure. Lydia had cleared
herself; Ferruci had proved himself innocent; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Lucian could not make up his mind what was now
to be done.</p>

<p>In this dilemma he sought out Diana, as, knowing
from experience that where a man's logic ends
a woman's instinct begins, he thought she might
suggest some way out of the difficulty. On arriving
at the Royal John Hotel he found that Diana was
waiting for him with great impatience; and hardly
giving herself time to greet him, she asked how
he had fared in his interview with Count Ferruci.</p>

<p>"Has that man been arrested, Mr. Denzil?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Vrain. I regret to say that he has
not been arrested. To speak plainly, he has, so
far as I can see, proved himself innocent."</p>

<p>"Innocent! And the evidence against him?"</p>

<p>"Is utterly useless. I brought him face to face
with the woman who sold the cloak, and she denies
that Ferruci bought it."</p>

<p>"But she said the buyer was an Italian."</p>

<p>"She did, and dark, with a moustache. All the
same, she did not recognise the Count. She says
the buyer was not so tall, and spoke worse English."</p>

<p>"Ferruci could make his English bad if he liked."</p>

<p>"Probably; but he could not make his stature
shorter. No, Miss Vrain, I am afraid that our
Italian friend, in spite of the evidence against him,
did not buy the cloak. That he resembles the purchaser
in looks and nationality is either a coincidence
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?" seeing that Lucian hesitated.</p>

<p>"Or design," finished the barrister. "And, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>deed,
the Count himself is of this opinion. He believes
that some one who wished to get him into
trouble personated him."</p>

<p>"Has he any suspicions as to whom the person
may be?"</p>

<p>"He says not, and I believe him; for if he did
suspect any particular individual he certainly would
gain nothing by concealment of the fact."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Diana thoughtfully, "so that denial
of the saleswoman disposes of the cloak's evidence.
What about the Count's presence in Jersey Street on
Christmas Eve?"</p>

<p>"He was not there!"</p>

<p>"But Rhoda, the servant, saw him both in the
house and in the back yard!"</p>

<p>"She saw a dark man, with a moustache, but
she could not say that he was a foreigner. She does
not know Ferruci, remember. The man she saw
must have been the same as the purchaser of the
cloak."</p>

<p>"Where does Ferruci say he was?"</p>

<p>"At Hampstead, visiting a friend."</p>

<p>"Oh! And what does the friend say?"</p>

<p>"He declares that the Count was with him on
Christmas Eve and stayed all night."</p>

<p>"That is very convenient evidence for the Count,
Mr. Denzil. Who is this accommodating friend?"</p>

<p>"A doctor called Jorce."</p>

<p>"Can his word be trusted?"</p>

<p>"So far as I can judge from his looks and a short
acquaintance, I should say so."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p><p>"It was half-past eight when the servant saw
the dark man run out of the yard?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"And at half-past eight Ferruci was at Hampstead
in the house of Dr. Jorce?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said Lucian, remembering
that he had asked Jorce the question rather generally
than particularly, "but the doctor declared that
Ferruci was with him at ten o'clock on that evening,
and did not leave him until next morning; so as
your father was killed between eleven and twelve,
Ferruci must be innocent."</p>

<p>"It would seem so, if this doctor is to be believed,"
muttered Diana reflectively, "but judging
by what you have told me, there is nothing to show
that Ferruci was <i>not</i> in Pimlico at eight-thirty, and
was <i>not</i> the man whom the servant saw."</p>

<p>"Well, certainly he could get from Pimlico to
Hampstead in an hour and a half. However, the
main point about all this evidence is, that neither
Ferruci nor Lydia Vrain killed your father."</p>

<p>"No! no! that seems clear. Still! still! they
know about it. Oh, I am sure of it. It must have
been Ferruci who was in Pimlico on that night.
If so, he knows who Wrent is, and why he stayed
in Jersey Street."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, although he denies ever hearing the
name of Wrent. But I would not be surprised if
the man who could solve the mystery is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"Doctor Jorce himself. I feel sure of it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>TWO MONTHS PASS</h3>


<p>Unwilling to give up prosecuting the Vrain
case while the slightest hope remained of solving
its mystery, Lucian sought out Link, the detective,
and detailed all the evidence he had collected since
the constituted authorities had abandoned the matter.
Although Mrs. Vrain and Ferruci had exculpated
themselves entirely, Denzil thought that
Link, with his professional distrust and trained
sense of ferreting out secrets, might discern better
than himself whether such exculpations were warranted
by circumstances.</p>

<p>Link heard all that Denzil had to tell him with
outward indifference and inward surprise; for while
unwilling, through jealousy of an amateur, to flatter
the barrister by a visible compliment, yet he silently
admitted that Denzil had made his discoveries and
profited by them with much acuteness. What annoyed
him, however, was that the young man had
pushed his inquiries to the uttermost limit; and that
there was no chance of any glory accruing to himself
by prosecuting them further. Still, on the possibility
that something might come of it, he went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>over the ground already traversed by the amateur
detective.</p>

<p>"You should have told me of your intentions
when Miss Vrain spoke to you in the first instance,"
he said to Lucian by way of rebuke. "As it is, you
have confused the clues so much that I do not know
which one to take."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I have pursued each clue until
fate or circumstance clipped it short," retorted
Lucian, nettled by this injustice. "Mrs. Vrain has
defended herself successfully, much in the same way
as Count Ferruci has done. Your only chance of
getting at the truth lies in discovering Wrent; and
unless Rhoda helps you there, I do not see how you
can trace the man."</p>

<p>"I am of a different opinion," said Link, lying
freely to conceal his doubts of success in the matter.
"As you have failed through lack of experience, I
shall attempt to unravel this skein."</p>

<p>"You attempted to do so before, and gave it
up because of the tangle," said Lucian with quiet
irony. "And unless you discover more than I have
done, you will dismiss the matter again as impossible.
So far as I can see, the mystery of Vrain's
death is more of a mystery than ever, and will never
be solved."</p>

<p>"I'll make one last attempt to unriddle it, however,"
answered Link, with a confidence he was
far from feeling, "but, of course&mdash;not being one of
your impossible detectives of fiction&mdash;I may fail."</p>

<p>"You are certain to fail," said Lucian decisively,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>and with this disheartening prophecy he left Link
to his task of&mdash;apparently&mdash;spinning ropes of sand.</p>

<p>Whether it was that Link was so doubtful of the
result as to extend little energy in the search, or
whether he really found the task impossible of accomplishment,
it is difficult to say, but assuredly he
failed as completely as Lucian predicted. With
outward zeal he set to work; interviewed Lydia and
the Italian, to make certain that their defence was
genuine; examined the Pegall family, who were
dreadfully alarmed by their respectability being intruded
upon by a common detective, and obtained
a fresh denial from Baxter &amp; Co.'s saleswoman that
Ferruci was the purchaser of the cloak. Also he
cross-questioned Mrs. Bensusan and her sharp
handmaid in the most exhaustive manner, and did
his best to trace out the mysterious Wrent who had
so much to do with the matter. He even called
on Dr. Jorce at Hampstead, to satisfy himself as to
the actual time of Ferruci's arrival in that neighbourhood
on Christmas Eve. But here he received
a check, for Jorce had gone abroad on his annual
holiday, and was not expected back for a month.</p>

<p>In fact, Link did all that a man could do to arrive
at the truth, only to find himself, at the end of
his labours, in the same position as Lucian had
been. Disgusted at this result, he threw up his
brief, and called upon Diana and Denzil, with
whom he had previously made an appointment, to
notify them of his inability to bring the matter to
a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p><p>"There is not the slightest chance of finding the
assassin of Mr. Vrain," said Link, after he had
set forth at length his late failures. "The more I
go into the matter the more I see it."</p>

<p>"Yet you were so confident of doing more than
I," said Lucian quietly.</p>

<p>Link turned sulkily, after the fashion of a bad
loser.</p>

<p>"I did my best," he retorted gloomily. "No
man can do more. Some crimes are beyond the
power of the law to punish for sheer lack of proof.
This is one of them; and, so far as I can see, this
unknown assassin will be punished on Judgment
Day&mdash;not before."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think that Signor Ferruci is
guilty?" said Diana.</p>

<p>"No. He has had nothing to do with the matter;
nor has Mrs. Vrain brought about the death
in any way."</p>

<p>"You cannot say who killed my father?"</p>

<p>"Not for certain, but I suspect Wrent."</p>

<p>"Then why not find Wrent?" asked Diana
bluntly.</p>

<p>"He has hidden his trail too well," began Link,
"and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if you did find him," finished Denzil coolly,
"he might prove himself guiltless, after the
fashion of Mrs. Vrain and Ferruci."</p>

<p>"He might, sir; there is no knowing. But since
you think I have done so little, Mr. Denzil, let me
ask you who it is you suspect?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p><p>"Dr. Jorce of Hampstead."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" cried Link, with contempt. "He
didn't kill the man&mdash;how could he, seeing he was
at Hampstead on that Christmas Eve midnight, as
I found out from his servants?"</p>

<p>"I don't suspect him of actually striking the
blow," replied Lucian, "but I believe he knows
who did."</p>

<p>"Not he! Dr. Jorce has too responsible a position
to mix himself up in a crime from which he
gains no benefit."</p>

<p>"Why! what position does he hold?"</p>

<p>"He is the owner of a private lunatic asylum.
Is it likely that a man like him would commit a
murder?"</p>

<p>"Again I deny that he did commit the crime;
but I am certain, from the very fact of his friendship
with Ferruci, that he knows more than he
chooses to tell. Why should the Italian be intimate
with the owner of a private asylum&mdash;with a
man so much beneath him in rank?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. But if you suspect Dr.
Jorce you had better see him when he comes back
from his holidays&mdash;in a month."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"In Italy, and the Count has gone with him."</p>

<p>Diana and Lucian looked at one another, and the
former spoke: "That is strange," she said. "I
agree with Mr. Denzil, it is peculiar, to say the
least of it, that an Italian noble should make a
bosom friend of a man so far inferior to him in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>position. Don't you think so yourself, Mr. Link?"</p>

<p>"Madam," said Link gravely, "I think nothing
about it, save that you will never find out the truth.
I have tried my best, and failed; and I am confident
enough in my own power to say that where I have
failed no one else will succeed. Miss Vrain, Mr.
Denzil, I wish you good-day."</p>

<p>And with this bragging speech, which revealed
the hurt vanity of the man, Mr. Link took his departure.
Lucian held his peace, for in the face of
this desertion of a powerful ally he did not know
what to say. Diana walked to the sitting-room window
and watched Link disappear into the crowd
of passers-by. At that she heaved a sigh, for with
him&mdash;she thought&mdash;went every chance of learning
the truth, since if he, an experienced person in such
matters, turned back from the quest, there could
assuredly be no help in any one not professional,
and with less trained abilities.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Lucian.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to be done, I suppose,"
said she, sighing again.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," replied Lucian dismally, for
he was quite of her opinion regarding the desertion
of the detective.</p>

<p>"Then I must leave this unknown assassin to the
punishment of God!" said Diana quietly. "And
I can only thank you for all you have done for me,
Mr. Denzil, and say"&mdash;she hesitated and blushed,
then added, with some emphasis&mdash;"say <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Denzil, with an indrawn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>breath of relief, "I am glad you did not say good-bye."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to say it, Mr. Denzil. I have
not so many friends in the world that I can afford
to lose so good a one as yourself."</p>

<p>"I am content," said Lucian softly, "that you
should think of me as your friend&mdash;for the present."</p>

<p>His meaning was so unmistakable that Diana,
still blushing, and somewhat confused, hastened to
prevent his saying more at so awkward a moment.
"Then as my friend I hope you will come and see
me at Berwin Manor."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted. When do you go down?"</p>

<p>"Within a fortnight. I must remain that time
in town to see my lawyer about the estate left by
my poor father."</p>

<p>"And see Mrs. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Diana coldly. "Now that my
father is dead, Mrs. Vrain is nothing to me. Indirectly,
I look upon her as the cause of his death,
for if she had not driven both of us out of our own
home, my father might have been alive still. I
shall not call on Mrs. Vrain, and I do not think
she will dare to call on me."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," rejoined Lucian, who
was well acquainted with the lengths to which Mrs.
Vrain's audacity would carry her; "but let us dismiss
her, with all your other troubles. May I call
on you again before you leave town?"</p>

<p>"Occasionally," replied Diana, smiling and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>blushing; "and you will come down to Berwin
Manor when I send you an invitation?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Denzil, in high glee, as
he rose to depart; "and now I will say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye?" said Miss Vrain, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>"No. I will use your own form of farewell&mdash;<i>au
revoir</i>."</p>

<p>Then Lucian went out from the presence of his
beloved, exulting that she had proved so kind as
not to dismiss him when she no longer required
his services. In another woman he would not have
minded such ingratitude, but had Diana banished
him thus he would have been miserable beyond
words. Also, as Lucian joyfully reflected, her invitation
to Berwin Manor showed that, far from
wishing to lose sight of him, she desired to draw
him into yet closer intimacy. There could be nothing
but good resulting from her invitation and his
acceptance, and already Denzil looked forward to
some bright summer's day in the green and leafy
country, when he should ask this goddess among
women to be his wife. If encouragement and looks
and blushes went for anything, he hardly doubted
the happy result.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while Lucian dreamed his
dreams, Diana, also dreaming in her own way, remained
in town and attended to business. She saw
her lawyers, and had her affairs looked into, so
that when she went to Bath she was legally installed
as the mistress of Berwin Manor and its surround<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>ing
acres. As Lucian hinted, Lydia did indeed try
to see her stepdaughter. She called twice, and was
refused admission into Diana's presence. She wrote
three times, and received no reply to her letters;
so the consequence was that, finding Diana declined
to have anything to do with her in any way whatsoever,
she became very bitter. This feeling she
expressed to Lucian, whom she one day met in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>"As if I had done anything," finished Lydia, after
a recital of all her grievances. "I call it real
mean. Don't you think so, Mr. Denzil?"</p>

<p>"If you ask me, Mrs. Vrain," said Lucian stiffly,
"I think you and Miss Vrain are better apart."</p>

<p>"Of course you defend her. But I guess I can't
blame you, as I know what you are driving at."</p>

<p>"What about Signor Ferruci?" asked Denzil,
parrying.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are good friends still, but nothing more.
As he proved that he did not kill Mark, I've no
reason to give him his walking-ticket. But," added
Mrs. Vrain drily, "I guess you'll be married to
Diana before I hitch up 'longside Ercole."</p>

<p>"How do you know I shall marry Miss Vrain?"
asked Lucian, flushing.</p>

<p>"If you saw your face in a glass, you wouldn't
ask, I guess. Tomatoes ain't in it for redness. I
won't dance at your wedding, and I won't break
my heart, either," and with a gay nod Mrs. Lydia
Vrain tripped away, evidently quite forgetful of the
late tragedy in her life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>AT BERWIN MANOR</h3>


<p>The heritage of Diana lay some miles from
Bath, in a pleasant wooded valley, through which
meandered a placid and slow-flowing stream. On
either side of this water stretched broad meadow
lands, flat and fertile, as well they might be, seeing
they were of rich black loam, and well drained,
withal. To the right these meadows were bounded
by forest lands, the trees of which grew thickly up
and over the ridge, and on the space where wood
met fields was placed the manor, a quaint square
building of Georgian architecture, and some two
centuries old.</p>

<p>Against the green of the trees its warm walls of
red brick and sloping roof of bluish slate made a
pleasant spot of colour. There stretched a terrace
before it; beneath the terrace a flower garden and
orchard; and below these the meadow lands, white
with snow in winter, black in spring, with ridgy
furrows, and golden with grain in the hot days of
summer. Altogether a lovely and peaceful spot,
where a man could pass pleasant days in rural quiet,
a hermitage of rest for the life-worn and heart-weary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p><p>Here, towards the end of summer, came Lucian,
to rest his brain after the turmoil of London, and
to court his mistress under the most favourable circumstances.
Diana had established herself in her
ancestral home with a superannuated governess as
a chaperon, for without such a guardianship she
could hardly have invited the barrister to visit her.
Miss Priscilla Barbar was a placid, silver-haired
old dame, who, having taught Diana for many
years, had returned, now that the American Mrs.
Vrain had departed, to spend the rest of her days
under the roof of her dear pupil.</p>

<p>She took a great fancy to Lucian, which was
just as well, seeing what was the object of his visit,
and complacently watched the growing attachment
between the handsome young couple, who seemed
so suited to one another. But her duties as chaperon
were nominal, for when not pottering about
the garden she was knitting in a snug corner, and
when knitting failed to interest her she slumbered
quietly, in defiance of the etiquette which should
have compelled her to make a third in the conversation
of her young friends.</p>

<p>As for Lucian and his charming hostess, they
found that they had so many tastes in common, and
enjoyed each other's society so much, that they
were hardly ever apart. Diana saw with the keen
eyes of a woman that Lucian was in love with her,
and let it be seen in a marvellously short space of
time, and without much difficulty, that she was in
love with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p><p>But even after Lucian had been at the manor a
fortnight, and daily in the society of Diana, he
spoke no word of love. Seeing how beautiful she
was, and how dowered with lands and rents and
horses, he began to ask himself whether it was not
rather a presumption on his part to ask her to share
his life. He had only three hundred a year&mdash;six
pounds a week&mdash;and a profession in which, as yet,
he had not succeeded; so he could offer her very little
in exchange for her beauty, wealth, and position.</p>

<p>The poor lover became quite pale with fruitless
longing, and his spirits fell so low that good Miss
Priscilla one day drew him aside to ask about his
health.</p>

<p>"For," said she, "if you are ill in body, Mr.
Denzil, I know of some remedies&mdash;old woman's
medicines you will call them, no doubt&mdash;which,
with the blessing of God, may do you good."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Barbar, but I am not ill in
body&mdash;worse luck!" and Lucian sighed.</p>

<p>"Why worse luck, Mr. Denzil?" said the old
lady severely. "That is an ungrateful speech to
Providence."</p>

<p>"I would rather be ill in body than ill in mind,"
explained Denzil, blushing, for in some ways he
was younger than his years.</p>

<p>"And are you ill in mind?" asked Miss Priscilla,
with a twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Alas! yes. Can you cure me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p><p>"No. For that cure I shall hand you over to
Diana."</p>

<p>"Miss Priscilla!" And Lucian coloured again,
this time with vexation.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Denzil," laughed the governess, "because
I am old you must not imagine that I am
blind. I see that you love Diana."</p>

<p>"Better than my life!" cried the devoted lover
with much fervour.</p>

<p>"Of course! That is the usual romantic answer
to make. Well, why do you not tell Diana so, with
any pretty additions your fancy suggests?"</p>

<p>"She might not listen to me," said this doubting
lover dolefully.</p>

<p>"Very true," replied his consoler. "On the other
hand, she might. Besides, Mr. Denzil, however
much the world may have altered since my youth, I
have yet to learn that it is the lady's part to propose
to the gentleman."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Barbar, I am poor!"</p>

<p>"What of that? Diana is rich."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it? For that very reason I hesitate
to ask her."</p>

<p>"Because you are afraid of being called a fortune-hunter,
I suppose," said the old lady drily. "That
shows a lack of moral courage which is not worthy
of you, Mr. Denzil. Take an old woman's advice,
young man, and put your fortunes to the test. Remember
Montrose's advice in the song."</p>

<p>"You approve of my marrying Diana&mdash;I mean
Miss Vrain?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p><p>"From what I have seen of you, and from what
Diana has told me about you, I could wish her no
better husband. Poor girl! After the tragical
death of her father, and her wretched life with that
American woman, she deserves a happy future."</p>

<p>"And do you think&mdash;do you really think that
she&mdash;that she&mdash;would be happy with&mdash;with me?"
stammered Lucian, hardly daring to believe Miss
Priscilla, whose acquaintance with him seemed too
recent to warrant such trust.</p>

<p>The wise old woman laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>"Ask her yourself, my dear," she said, patting
his hand. "She will be able to answer that question
better than I. Besides, girls like to say 'yea' or
'nay,' themselves."</p>

<p>This seemed to be good advice, and certainly
none could have been more grateful to the timid
lover. That very night he made up his mind to
risk his fortunes by speaking to Diana. It was
no easy matter for the young man to bring himself
to do so, for cool, bold, and fluent as he was on
ordinary occasions, the fever of love rendered him
shy and nervous. The looks of Diana acted on his
spirits as the weather does on a barometer. A smile
made him jocund and hilarious, a frown abashed
him almost to gloom. And in the April weather of
her presence he was as variable as a weather-cock.
It is, therefore, little to be wondered at that one
ordinarily daring should tremble to ask a question
which might be answered in the negative. True,
Miss Barbar's partisanship heartened him a trifle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>but he still feared for the result. Cupid, as well
as conscience, makes cowards of us all&mdash;and Lucian
was a doubting lover.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his stay Miss Priscilla&mdash;as
usual&mdash;fell asleep one evening after dinner, and
Diana, feeling the house too warm, stepped out
into the garden, followed by Lucian. The sun had
just set behind the undulating hills, and the clear
sky, to the zenith, was of a pale rose colour, striped
towards the western horizon with lines of golden
cloud. In the east a cold blue prevailed, and here
and there a star sparkled in the arch of the sky.</p>

<p>The garden was filled with floating shadows,
which seemed to glide into it from the dark recesses
of the near woods, and in a copse some distance
away a nightingale was singing to his mate,
and filling the silence with melody. The notes fluted
sweetly through the still air, mingling with the sigh
of the rising wind and the musical splashing of the
fountain. This shot up a pillar of silvery water to
a great height, and in descending sprinkled the near
flower beds with its cold spray. All was inexpressibly
beautiful to the eye and soothing to the ear&mdash;a
scene and an hour for love. It might have been
the garden of the Capulets, and those who moved
in it&mdash;the immortal lovers, as yet uncursed by Fate.</p>

<p>"Only three more days," sighed Lucian as he
walked slowly down the path beside Diana, "and
then that noisy London again."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is as well," said Diana, in her prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>tical
way. "You would rust here. But is there
any need for you to go back so soon?"</p>

<p>"I must&mdash;for my own peace of mind."</p>

<p>Diana started and blushed at the meaning of his
tone and words.</p>

<p>Then she recovered her serenity and sat down on
an old stone seat, near which stood a weather-beaten
statue of Venus. Seeing that she kept silent in spite
of his broad hint, Lucian&mdash;to bring matters to a
crisis&mdash;resolved to approach the subject in a mythological
way through the image of the goddess.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I am not a Greek, Miss Vrain," he
said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Diana, secretly astonished by the
irrelevancy of the remark.</p>

<p>Lucian plucked a red rose from the bush which
grew near the statue and placed it on the pedestal.</p>

<p>"Because I would lay my offering at the feet of
the goddess, and touch her knees to demand a
boon."</p>

<p>"What boon would you ask?" said Diana in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"I would beseech that in return for my rose of
flowers she would give me the rose of womanhood."</p>

<p>"A modest request. Do you think it would be
granted?"</p>

<p>"Do you?" asked Lucian, picking up the rose
again.</p>

<p>"How can I reply to your parables, or read your
dark sayings?" said Diana, half in earnest, half in
mirth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p><p>"I can speak plainer if you permit it."</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if you like!"</p>

<p>The young man laid the rose on Diana's lap.
"Then in return for my rose give me&mdash;yourself!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Denzil!" cried Diana, starting up, whereby
the flower fell to the ground. "You&mdash;you surprise
me!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I surprise myself," said Lucian sadly.
"That I should dare to raise my eyes to you is no
doubt surprising."</p>

<p>"I don't see that at all," exclaimed Diana coldly.
"I like to be woo'd like a woman, not honoured like
a goddess."</p>

<p>"You are both woman and goddess! But&mdash;you
are not angry?"</p>

<p>"Why should I be angry?"</p>

<p>"Because I&mdash;I love you!"</p>

<p>"I cannot be angry with&mdash;with&mdash;shall we say a
compliment."</p>

<p>"Oh, Diana!"</p>

<p>"Wait! wait!" cried Miss Vrain, waving back
this too eager lover. "You cannot love me! You
have known me only a month or two."</p>

<p>"Love can be born in an hour," cried Lucian
eagerly. "I loved you on the first day I saw you!
I love you now&mdash;I shall love you ever!"</p>

<p>"Will you truly love me ever, Lucian?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling! Can you doubt it? And
you?" He looked at her hopefully.</p>

<p>"And I?" she repeated in a pretty mocking tone,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>"and I?" With a laugh, she bent and picked up
the flower. "I take the rose and I give you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yourself!" cried the enraptured lover, and the
next moment he was clasping her to his breast.
"Oh, Diana, dearest! Will you really be my wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said softly, and kissed him.</p>

<p>For a few moments the emotions of both overcame
them too much to permit further speech; then
Diana sat down and made Lucian sit beside her.</p>

<p>"Lucian," she said in a firm voice, "I love you,
and I shall be your wife&mdash;when you find out who
killed my poor father!"</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" he cried in dismay.</p>

<p>"No. We must prosecute the search. I have
no right to be happy while the wretch who killed
him is still at large. We have failed hitherto, but
we may succeed yet! and when we succeed I shall
marry you."</p>

<p>"My darling!" cried Lucian in ecstasy; and then
in a more subdued tone: "I'll do all I can to find
out the truth. But, after all, from what point can
I begin afresh?"</p>

<p>"From the point of Mrs. Vrain," said Diana unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vrain!" cried the startled Lucian. "Do
you still suspect her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!"</p>

<p>"But she has cleared herself on the most undeniable
evidence."</p>

<p>"Not in my eyes," said Diana obstinately. "If
Mrs. Vrain is innocent, how did she find out that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>the unknown man murdered in Geneva Square was
my father?"</p>

<p>"By his assumption of the name of Berwin,
which was mentioned in the advertisement; also
from the description of the body, and particularly
by the mention of the cicatrice on the right cheek,
and of the loss of the little finger of the left hand."</p>

<p>Diana started. "I never heard that about the
little finger," she said hurriedly. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw myself when I knew your father
as Berwin, that he had lost that little finger."</p>

<p>"Then, Lucian, you did <i>not</i> see my father!"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Denzil, hardly able to credit her
words.</p>

<p>"My father never lost a finger!" cried Diana,
starting to her feet. "Ah, Lucian, I now begin to
see light. That man who called himself Berwin,
who was murdered, was not my father. No, I believe&mdash;on
my soul, I believe that my father, Mark
Vrain, is alive!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>A STARTLING THEORY</h3>


<p>When Diana declared that her father yet lived,
Lucian drew back from her in amazement, for of
all impossible things said of this impossible case
this saying of hers was the strangest and most incredible.
Hitherto, not a suspicion had entered his
mind but that the man so mysteriously slain in Geneva
Square was Mark Vrain, and, for the moment,
he thought that Diana was distraught to deny so
positive a fact.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," said he, shaking his head,
"quite impossible. Mrs. Vrain identified the corpse,
and so did other people who knew your father
well."</p>

<p>"As to Mrs. Vrain," said Diana contemptuously,
"I quite believe she would lie to gain her own ends.
And it may be that the man who was murdered was
like my father in the face, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had the mark on his cheek," interrupted
Lucian, impatient of this obstinate belief in the
criminality of Lydia.</p>

<p>"I know that mark well," replied Miss Vrain.
"My father received it in a duel he fought in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>youth, when he was a student in a German university;
but the missing finger." She shook her head.</p>

<p>"He might have lost the finger while you were in
Australia," suggested the barrister.</p>

<p>"He might," rejoined Diana doubtfully, "but it
is unlikely. As to other people identifying the
body, they no doubt did so by looking at the face
and its scar. Still, I do not believe the murdered
man was my father."</p>

<p>"If not, why should Mrs. Vrain identify the body
as that of her husband?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because she wanted to get the assurance
money."</p>

<p>"She may have been misled by the resemblance of
the dead man to your father."</p>

<p>"And who provided that resemblance? My dear
Lucian, I would not be at all surprised to learn that
there was conspiracy as well as murder in this matter.
My father left his home, and Lydia could
not find him. I quite believe that. As she cannot
prove his death, she finds it impossible to obtain
the assurance money; so what does she do?"</p>

<p>"I cannot guess," said Lucian, anxious to hear
Diana's theory.</p>

<p>"Why, she finds a man who resembles my father,
and sets him to play the part of the recluse in Geneva
Square. She selects a man in ill health and
given to drink, that he may die the sooner; and, by
being buried as Mark Vrain, give her the money she
wants. When you told me of this man Berwin's
coughing and drinking, I thought it strange, as my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>father had no consumptive disease when I left him,
and never, during his life, was he given to over-indulgence
in drink. Now I see the truth. This
dead man was Lydia's puppet."</p>

<p>"Even granting that this is so, which I doubt,
Diana, why should the man be murdered?"</p>

<p>"Why?" cried Diana fiercely. "Because he was
not dying quickly enough for that woman's purpose.
She did not kill him herself, if her alibi is
to be credited, but she employed Ferruci to murder
him."</p>

<p>"You forget Signor Ferruci also proved an
alibi."</p>

<p>"A very doubtful one," said Miss Vrain scornfully.
"You did not ask that Dr. Jorce the questions
you should have done. Go up to London now,
Lucian, see him at Hampstead, and find out if Ferruci
was at his house at eight o'clock on Christmas
Eve. Then I shall believe him guiltless; till then,
I hold him but the creature and tool of Lydia."</p>

<p>"Jorce declares that Ferruci was with him at the
house when the murder was committed?"</p>

<p>"Can you believe that? Ferruci may have made
it worth the while of this doctor to lie. And even
granting that much, the presence of Ferruci at the
Jersey Street house shows that he knew what was
going to take place on that night, and perhaps arranged
with another man to do the deed. Either
way you look at it, he and Lydia are implicated."</p>

<p>"I tell you it is impossible, Diana," said Lucian,
finding it vain to combat this persistent belief. "All
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>this plotting of crime is such as is found in novels,
not in real life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In real life," cried Diana, taking the words out
of his mouth, "more incredible things take place
than can be conceived by the most fantastic imagination
of an author. Look at this talk of ours&mdash;it
began with words of love and marriage speeches,
and it ends with a discussion of murder. But this
I say, Lucian, that if you love me, and would have
me marry you, you must find out the truth of these
matters. Learn if this dead man is my father&mdash;for
from what you have told me of the lost finger I
do not believe that he is. Hunt down the assassin,
and discover if he is whom I believe him to be&mdash;Ferruci
himself; and learn, if you can, what Lydia
has to do with all these evil matters. Do this, and
I am yours. Refuse, and I shall not marry you!"</p>

<p>"You set me a hard task," said Lucian, with a
sigh, "and I hardly know how to set about it."</p>

<p>"Be guided by me," replied Diana. "Go up to
London and put an advertisement in the papers offering
a reward for the discovery of my father.
He is of medium height, with grey hair, and has a
clean-shaven face, with a scar on it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You describe the dead man, Diana."</p>

<p>"But he has not lost a finger," continued Diana,
as though she had not heard him. "If my father,
for fear of Lydia, is in hiding, he will come to you
or me in answer to that advertisement."</p>

<p>"But he must have seen the report of his death
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>by violence in the papers, if indeed he is alive,"
urged Lucian, at his wit's end.</p>

<p>"My father is weak in the head, and perhaps
was afraid to come out in the midst of such trouble.
But if you put in the advertisement that I&mdash;his
daughter&mdash;am in England, he will come to me, for
with me he knows he is safe. Also call on Dr.
Jorce, and find out the truth about Signor Ferruci."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then when you have done these two things we
shall see what will come of them. Promise me to
do what I ask you."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Lucian, taking her hand, "but
you send me on a wild-goose chase."</p>

<p>"That may be, Lucian, but my heart&mdash;my presentiment&mdash;my&mdash;instinct&mdash;whatever
you like to call
it&mdash;tells me otherwise. Now let us go inside."</p>

<p>"Shall we tell Miss Barbar of our engagement?"
asked Denzil timidly.</p>

<p>"No; you will tell no one of that until we learn
the truth of this conspiracy. When we do, Lucian,
you will find that my father is not dead but is alive,
and will be at our wedding."</p>

<p>"I doubt it&mdash;I doubt it."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," answered Diana, and slipping
her hand within the arm of her lover she walked
with him up to the house. It was the strangest of
wooings.</p>

<p>Miss Barbar, with a true woman's interest in love
affairs, was inclined to congratulate them both when
they entered, deeming&mdash;as the chance had been so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>propitious&mdash;that Lucian had proposed. But Diana
looked so stern, and Lucian so gloomy, that she held
her peace.</p>

<p>Later on, when her curiosity got the better of
her desire not to offend her pupil, she asked if Denzil
had spoken.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Diana, "he has spoken."</p>

<p>"And you have refused him?" cried the old lady
in dismay, for she did not relish the idea that Lucian
should have lost by her counsel.</p>

<p>"No; I have not refused him."</p>

<p>"Then you have said 'yes,' my dear!"</p>

<p>"I have said sufficient," replied Diana cautiously.
"Please do not question me any further, Miss Barbar.
Lucian and I understand one another very
well."</p>

<p>"She calls him by his Christian name," thought
the wise old dame, "that is well. She will not speak
of her happiness, that is ill," and in various crafty
ways Miss Barbar tried to learn how matters actually
stood between the pair.</p>

<p>But if she was skilful in asking questions, Diana
was equally skilful in baffling them, and Miss Barbar
learned nothing more than her pupil chose to
tell her, and that was little enough. To perplex her
still further, Lucian departed for London the next
day, with a rather disconsolate look on his handsome
face, and gave his adviser no very satisfactory
explanation at parting.</p>

<p>So Miss Barbar was forced to remain in ignorance
of the success or failure of her counsel, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>could by no means discover if the marriage she was
so anxious to bring about was likely to take place.
And so ended Denzil's visit to Berwin Manor.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Lucian went back to London
with a heavy heart, for he did not see how he was
to set about the task imposed on him by Diana.
At first he thought it would be best to advertise,
as she advised, but this he considered would do no
good, as if Vrain&mdash;supposing him to be alive and
in hiding&mdash;would not come out at the false report
of his murder, he certainly would not appear in answer
to an advertisement that might be a snare.</p>

<p>Then Lucian wondered if it would be possible
to have the grave opened a second time that Diana
might truly see if the corpse was that of her father
or of another man. But this also was impossible,
and&mdash;to speak plainly&mdash;useless, for by this time the
body would not be recognisable; therefore, it would
be of little use to exhume the poor dead man, whomsoever
he might be, for the second time. Finally,
Lucian judged it would be wisest of all to call on
Dr. Jorce, and find out why he was friendly with
Ferruci, and how much he knew of the Italian's
doings.</p>

<p>While the barrister was making up his mind to
this course he was surprised to receive a visit from
no less a person than Mr. Jabez Clyne, the father
of Lydia.</p>

<p>The little man, usually so bright and merry, now
looked worried and ill at ease. Lucian&mdash;so much
as he had seen of him&mdash;had always liked him better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>than Lydia, and was sorry to see him so downcast.
Nor when he learned the reason was he better
pleased. Clyne told it to him in a roundabout
way.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything against Signor Ferruci?"
he asked, when the first greetings were over.</p>

<p>"Very little, and that bad," replied Denzil
shortly.</p>

<p>"Do you refer to the horrible death of my son-in-law?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Mr. Clyne. I believe Ferruci had a
hand in it, and if you bring him here I'll tell him
so."</p>

<p>"Can you prove it?" asked Clyne eagerly.</p>

<p>"No. As yet, Ferruci has proved that he was
not in Geneva Square on the night of the crime&mdash;or
rather," added Lucian, correcting himself, "at
the hour when the murder was committed."</p>

<p>Clyne's face fell. "I wish you could discover if
he is guilty or not," he said. "I am anxious to
know the truth."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lucian bluntly.</p>

<p>"Because if he is guilty, I don't want my daughter
to marry a murderer."</p>

<p>"What! Is Mrs. Vrain going to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the little man disconsolately, "and I
wish she wasn't."</p>

<p>"So do I&mdash;for her own sake. I thought she did
not like him. She said as much to me."</p>

<p>"I can't make her out, Mr. Denzil. She grew
tired of him for a time, but now she has taken up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>with him again, and nothing I can say or do will
stop the marriage. I love Lydia beyond words, as
she is my only child, and I don't want to see her
married to a man of doubtful reputation like Ferruci.
So I thought I'd call and see if you could
help me."</p>

<p>"I can't," replied Lucian. "As yet I have found
out nothing likely to implicate Ferruci in the
crime."</p>

<p>"But you may," said Clyne hopefully.</p>

<p>Lucian shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"If I do, you shall know at once," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>LUCIAN IS SURPRISED</h3>


<p>Although Denzil received Mr. Clyne with all
courtesy, and promised to aid him, if he could, in
breaking off the marriage with Ferruci, by revealing
his true character to Mrs. Vrain, he by no
means made a confidant of the little man, or entrusted
him with the secret of his plans. Clyne, as
he well knew, was dominated in every way by his
astute daughter, and did he learn Lucian's intentions,
he was quite capable&mdash;through sheer weakness
of character&mdash;of revealing the same to Lydia,
who, in her turn&mdash;since she was bent upon marrying
Ferruci&mdash;might retail them to the Italian, and
so put him on his guard.</p>

<p>Denzil, therefore, rid himself of the American
by promising to tell him, on some future occasion,
all that he knew about Ferruci. Satisfied with this,
Clyne departed in a more cheerful mood, and, apparently,
hoped for the best.</p>

<p>After his departure, Lucian again began to consider
his idea of calling on Jorce regarding the alibi
of Ferruci. On further reflection he judged that,
before paying the visit to Hampstead, it might be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>judicious to see Rhoda again, and refresh his memory
in connection with the events of Christmas Eve.
With this idea he put on his hat, and shortly after
the departure of Clyne walked round to Jersey
Street.</p>

<p>On ringing the bell, the door was opened by
Rhoda in person, looking sharper and more cunning
than ever. She informed him that he could
not see Mrs. Bensusan, as that good lady was in
bed with a cold.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see your mistress, my girl,"
said Lucian quickly, to stop Rhoda from shutting
the door in his face, which she seemed disposed to
do. "I desire to speak with you."</p>

<p>"About that there murder?" asked Rhoda sharply.
Then in reply to the nod of Lucian she continued:
"I told you all I knew about it when you
called before. I don't know nothing more."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the name of the dark man you
saw in the yard?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. I know nothing about him."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear Mr. Wrent mention his
name?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He called and he went, and I saw
him in the back yard at 8.30. I never spoke to
him, and he never spoke to me."</p>

<p>"Could you swear to the man if you saw him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could. Have you got him with you?"
asked Rhoda eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not at present," answered Lucian, rather surprised
by the vindictive expression on the girl's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>face. "But later on I may call upon you to identify
him."</p>

<p>"Do you know who he is?" asked the servant
quickly.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Did he kill that man?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Denzil, wondering at these very
pointed questions. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"I have my reasons, sir. Where is my cloak?"</p>

<p>"I will return it later on; it will probably be
used as evidence."</p>

<p>Rhoda started. "Where?" she demanded, with
a frown.</p>

<p>"At the trial."</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll hang the person who killed
Mr. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"If the police catch him, and his guilt is proved,
I am sure they will hang him."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes flashed with a wicked light, and
she clasped and unclasped her hands with a quick,
nervous movement. "I hope they will," she said
in a low, rapid voice. "I hope they will."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Lucian, with a step forward. "Do
you know the assassin?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Rhoda, with much vehemence. "I
swear I don't, but I think the murderer ought to
be hanged. I know&mdash;I know&mdash;well, I know something&mdash;see
me to-morrow night, and you'll hear."</p>

<p>"Hear what?"</p>

<p>"The truth," said this strange girl, and shut the
door before Lucian could say another word.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p><p>The barrister, quite dumbfounded, remained on
the step looking at the closed door. So important
were Rhoda's words that he was on the point of
ringing again, to interview her once more and force
her to speak. But when he reflected that Mrs.
Bensusan was in bed, and that Rhoda alone could
reopen the door&mdash;which from her late action it
was pretty evident she would not do&mdash;he decided to
retire for the present. It was little use to call
in the police, or create trouble by forcing his way
into the house, as that might induce Rhoda to run
away before giving her evidence. So Lucian departed,
with the intention of keeping the next
night's appointment, and hearing what Rhoda had
to say.</p>

<p>"The truth," he repeated, as he walked along
the street. "Evidently she knows who killed this
man. If so, why did she not speak before, and why
is she so vindictive? Heavens! If Diana's belief
should be a true one, and her father not dead? Conspiracy!
murder! this gypsy girl, that subtle Italian,
and the mysterious Wrent! My head is in a whirl.
I cannot understand what it all means. To-morrow,
when Rhoda speaks, I may. But&mdash;can I trust her?
I doubt it. Still, there is nothing else for it. I
<i>must</i> trust her."</p>

<p>Talking to himself in this incoherent way, Lucian
reached his rooms and tried to quiet the excitement
of his brain caused by the strange words of
Rhoda. It was yet early in the afternoon, so he
took up a book and threw himself on the sofa to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>read for an hour, but he found it quite impossible
to fix his attention on the page. The case in which
he was concerned was far more exciting than any
invention of the brain, and after a vain attempt to
banish it from his mind he jumped up and threw
the book aside.</p>

<p>Although he did not know it, Lucian was suffering
from a sharp attack of detective fever, and the
only means of curing such a disease is to learn the
secret which haunts the imagination. Rhoda, as
she stated&mdash;rather ambiguously, it must be confessed&mdash;could
reveal this especial secret touching
the murder of Vrain; but, for some hidden reason,
chose to delay her confession for twenty-four hours.
Lucian, all on fire with curiosity, found himself unable
to bear this suspense, so to distract his mind
and learn, if possible, the true relationship existing
between Ferruci and Jorce, he set out for Hampstead
to interview the doctor.</p>

<p>"The Haven," as Jorce, with some humour,
termed his private asylum, was a red brick house,
large, handsome, and commodious, built in a wooded
and secluded part of Hampstead. It was surrounded
by a high brick wall, over which the trees
of its park could be seen, and possessed a pair of
elaborate iron gates, opening on to a quiet country
lane. Externally, it looked merely the estate of
a gentleman.</p>

<p>The grounds were large, and well laid out in
flower gardens and orchards; and as it was Dr.
Jorce's system to allow his least crazy patients as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>much liberty as possible, they roamed at will round
the grounds, giving the place a cheerful and populated
look. The more violent inmates were, of
course, secluded; but these were well and kindly
treated by the doctor. Indeed, Jorce was a very
humane man, and had a theory that more cures of
the unhappy beings under his charge could be effected
by kindness than by severity.</p>

<p>His asylum was more like a private hotel with
paying guests than an establishment for the retention
of the insane, and even to an outside observer
the eccentricities of the doctor's family&mdash;as he loved
to call them&mdash;were not more marked than many of
the oddities possessed by people at large. Indeed,
Jorce was in the habit of saying that "There were
more mad people in the world than were kept under
lock and key," and in this he was doubtless
right. However, the kindly and judicious little
man was like a father to those under his charge, and
very popular with them all. Anything more unlike
the popular conception of an asylum than the establishment
at Hampstead can scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>When Lucian arrived at "The Haven," he found
that Jorce had long since returned from his holiday,
and was that day at home; so on sending in
his card he was at once admitted into the presence
of the local potentate. Jorce, looking smaller and
more like a fairy changeling than ever, was evidently
pleased to see Lucian, but a look on his dry, yellow
face indicated that he was somewhat puzzled to
account for the visit. However, preliminary greet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>ings
having passed, Lucian did not leave him long
in doubt.</p>

<p>"Dr. Jorce," he said boldly, and without preamble,
"I have called to see you about that alibi
of Signor Ferruci's."</p>

<p>"Alibi is a nasty word, Mr. Denzil," said Jorce,
looking sharply at his visitor.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but it is the only word that can be
used with propriety."</p>

<p>"But I thought that I was called on to decide
a bet."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was Count Ferruci's clever way of putting it,"
responded Lucian, with a sneer. "He did
not wish you to know too much about his business."</p>

<p>"H'm! Perhaps I know more than you think,
Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" cried Lucian sharply.</p>

<p>"Softly, Mr. Denzil, softly," rejoined the doctor,
waving his hand. "I shall explain everything
to your satisfaction. Do you know why I went to
Italy?"</p>

<p>"No; no more than I know why you went with
Signor Ferruci," replied Lucian, recalling Link's
communication.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Jorce placidly, "you have been making
inquiries, I see. But you are wrong in one
particular. I did not go to Italy with Ferruci&mdash;I
left him in Paris, and I went on myself to Florence
to find out the true character of the man."</p>

<p>"Why did you wish to do that, doctor?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p><p>"Because I had some business with our mutual
friend, the Count, and I was not altogether pleased
with the way in which it was conducted. Also, my
last interview with you about that bet made me
suspicious of the man. Over in Florence I learned
sufficient about the Count to assure me that he is
a bad man, with whom it is as well to have as little
to do as possible. I intended to return at once
with this information and call on you, Mr. Denzil.
Unfortunately, I fell ill of an attack of typhoid
fever in Florence, and had to stay there these two
months."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Lucian, noting that the doctor
did look ill, "but why did you not send on your
information to me?"</p>

<p>"It was necessary to see you personally, Mr. Denzil.
I arrived back a few days ago, and intended
writing to you when I recovered from the fatigue
of the journey. However, your arrival saves me
the trouble. Now I can tell you all about Ferruci,
if you like."</p>

<p>"Then tell me, Doctor, if you spoke truly about
that alibi?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. Count Ferruci was with me that
night, and stayed here until the next morning."</p>

<p>"What time did he arrive?"</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock, or, to be precise," said Jorce,
"about ten-thirty."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Lucian exultantly, "then Ferruci
must have been the man in the back yard!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p><p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Jorce in
a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"Why, that Count Ferruci has had to do with a
crime committed some months ago in Pimlico. A
man called Mark Vrain was murdered, as you may
have seen in the papers, Doctor, and I believe
Ferruci murdered him."</p>

<p>"If I remember rightly," said Jorce with calmness,
"the man in question was murdered shortly
before midnight on Christmas Eve. If that is so,
Ferruci could not have killed him, because, as I
said before, he was here at half-past ten on that
night."</p>

<p>"I don't say he actually killed the man," explained
Lucian eagerly, "but he certainly employed
some one to strike the blow, else what was he doing
in the Jersey Street yard on that night? You can
say what you like, Dr. Jorce, but that man is guilty
of Mark Vrain's death."</p>

<p>"No," replied Jorce coolly, "he's not, for the
simple reason that Vrain is not dead."</p>

<p>"Not dead?" repeated Lucian, recalling Diana's
belief.</p>

<p>"No! For the last few months Mark Vrain, under
the name of Michael Clear, has been in this
asylum!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>A DARK PLOT</h3>


<p>"So Vrain is alive, after all!" was Lucian's comment
on the speech of Jorce, "and he is here under
your charge? Jove! it's wonderful! Diana was
right, after all!"</p>

<p>"Diana? Who is Diana?" queried Jorce, then
held up his hand to stop his visitor from replying.
"Wait! I know! Vrain mentioned his daughter
Diana."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is the daughter of Vrain, and she believes
her father to be alive."</p>

<p>"On what grounds?"</p>

<p>"Because the dead man, whom, until lately, she
believed to be Mr. Vrain, had one of his little
fingers missing. That fact came to her knowledge
only a week ago. When it did, she declared that
the deceased could not be her father."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Jorce thoughtfully, "I am quite in
the dark as to why Mr. Vrain was put under my
charge."</p>

<p>"Because Ferruci wished to marry his widow."</p>

<p>"I see! Ferruci substituted another man for my
patient and had him killed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p><p>"Evidently," replied Lucian; "but I am almost
as much in the dark as you are, Dr. Jorce. Tell me
how Vrain came to be placed here, and, exchanging
confidence for confidence, I'll let you know all I
have discovered since the death of the man in Geneva
Square who called himself Berwin."</p>

<p>"That is a fair offer," replied Jorce, clearing his
throat, "and one which I willingly accept. I do not
wish you to think that I am in league with Signor
Ferruci. What I did was done honestly. I am not
afraid of telling my story."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," said Lucian heartily. "I
guessed that Ferruci had not trusted you altogether,
from the time he feigned that your evidence was
needed only to decide a bet."</p>

<p>"Trust me!" echoed Jorce, with scorn. "He never
trusted me at all. He is too cunning for that.
However, you shall hear."</p>

<p>"I'm all attention, Doctor."</p>

<p>"A week before last Christmas, Signor Ferruci
called to see me, and explained that he was interested
in a gentleman called Michael Clear, whom he
had met some years before in Italy. Clear, he said,
had been most intimate with him, but later on had
indulged so much in the morphia habit that their
friendship had terminated with high words. Afterwards,
Clear had returned to England, and Ferruci
lost sight of him for some months. Then he visited
England, and one day found Clear in the street,
looking ill and wretched. The man had become a
confirmed morphiamaniac, and the habit had weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>ened
his brain. The Count pitied the poor creature,
according to his own story, and took him to his
home, the whereabouts of which Clear was happily
able to remember."</p>

<p>"Where is the house?" asked Lucian, taking out
his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Number 30, St. Bertha's Road, Bayswater,"
replied Jorce; and when the barrister, for his private
information, had made a note of the address,
he continued: "It then appeared that Clear was
married. The wife told Ferruci that she was afraid
of her husband, who, in his fits of drink&mdash;for he
drank likewise&mdash;often threatened to kill her. They
had lost their money, and the poor woman was at
her wit's end what to do. Ferruci explained to me
that out of friendship he was most anxious to befriend
Clear, and stated that Mrs. Clear wished
to get her husband cured. He proposed, therefore,
to put Clear into my asylum, and pay on behalf of
the wife."</p>

<p>"A very ingenious and plausible plan," said Lucian.
"Well, Doctor, and what did you say?"</p>

<p>"I agreed, of course, provided the man was certified
insane in the usual way. Ferruci then departed,
promising to bring Mrs. Clear to see me.
He brought her late on Christmas Eve, at ten&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" interrupted Lucian, "did she wear a black
gauze veil with velvet spots?"</p>

<p>"She did, Mr. Denzil. Have you met her?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have heard of her. She was the
woman who visited Wrent in Jersey Street. No
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>doubt Ferruci was waiting for her in the back
yard."</p>

<p>"Who is Wrent?" asked Jorce, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"Don't you know the name, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Clear never mention it?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Nor Ferruci?"</p>

<p>"No. I never heard the name before," replied
Jorce complacently.</p>

<p>"Strange!" said Denzil reflectively. "Yet Wrent
seems to be at the bottom of the whole plot. Well,
never mind, just now. Please continue, my dear
Doctor. What did Mrs. Clear say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she repeated Ferruci's story, amplified in
a feminine fashion. She was afraid of Michael,
who, when excited with morphia or drink, would
snatch up a knife to attempt her life. Twice she
had disarmed him, and now she was tired and
frightened. She was willing for him to go into my
asylum since Count Ferruci had so kindly consented
to bear the expense, but she wished to give him one
more chance. Then, as it was late, she stayed here
all night. So did the Count, and on Christmas Day
they went away."</p>

<p>"When did they come back?"</p>

<p>"About a fortnight later, and they brought with
them the man they both called Michael Clear."</p>

<p>"What is he like?"</p>

<p>"An old man with a white beard."</p>

<p>"Is he mad?" asked Lucian bluntly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p><p>"He is not mad now, only weak in the head,"
replied Jorce professionally, "but he was certainly
mad when he arrived. The man's brain is wrecked
by morphia."</p>

<p>"Not by drink?"</p>

<p>"No; although it suited Mrs. Clear and Ferruci
to say so. But Clear, as I may call him, was very
violent, and quite justified Mrs. Clear's desire to
sequester him. She told me that he often imagined
himself to be other people. Sometimes he would
feign to be Napoleon; again the Pope; so when
he, a week after he was in the asylum, insisted
that he was Mark Vrain, I put it down to his delusion."</p>

<p>"But how could you think he had come by the
name, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, at that time the papers were full
of the case and its mystery, and as we have a reading-room
in this asylum, I fancied that Clear had
seen the accounts, and had, as a delusion, called
himself Vrain. Afterwards he fell into a kind of
comatose state, and for weeks said very little. He
was most abject and frightened, and responded in
a timid sort of way to the name of Clear. Naturally
this confirmed me in my belief that his calling
himself Vrain was a delusion. Then he grew better,
and one day told me that his name was Vrain.
Of course, I did not believe him. Still, he was so
persistent about the matter that I thought there
might be something in it, and spoke to Ferruci."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p><p>"He denied that the man's name was anything
but Clear. That the wife and two doctors&mdash;for
the poor soul had been duly certified as insane&mdash;had
put him into the asylum; and altogether persisted
so strongly in his original story that I thought
it was absurd to put a crazy man's delusion against
a sane man's tale. Besides, everything regarding
the certificate and sequestrating of Clear had been
quite legal. Two doctors&mdash;and very rightly, too&mdash;had
certified to the insanity of the man; and his
wife&mdash;as I then believed Mrs. Clear to be&mdash;had
consented to his detention."</p>

<p>"What made you suspicious that there might be
something wrong?" asked Lucian eagerly.</p>

<p>"My visit to meet you, at Ferruci's request, to
prove the alibi," responded Jorce. "I thought it
was strange, and afterwards, when a detective
named Mr. Link, called, I thought it was stranger
still."</p>

<p>"But you did not see Link?"</p>

<p>"No. I was in Italy then, but I heard of his
visit. In Florence I heard from a most accomplished
gossip the whole story of Mr. Vrain's marriage and
the prior engagement of Mrs. Vrain to Ferruci. I
guessed that there might be some plot, but I could
not quite understand how it was carried out, save
that Vrain&mdash;as I then began to believe Clear to be&mdash;had
been placed in my asylum under a false name.
On my return I intended to see you, when I was
laid up in Florence with the fever. Now, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>that we have met, tell me so much of the story as
you know. Afterwards we shall see Mr. Vrain."</p>

<p>Lucian was willing enough to show his confidence
in Jorce, the more so as he needed his help.
Forthwith he told him all he knew, from the time
he had met Michael Clear, <i>alias</i> Mark Berwin, <i>alias</i>
Mark Vrain, in Geneva Square, down to the moment
he had presented himself for information at
the gates of "The Haven." Doctor Jorce listened
with the greatest attention, his little face puckered
up into a grim smile, and shook his head when the
barrister ended his recital.</p>

<p>"A bad world, Mr. Denzil, a bad world!" he
said, rising. "Come with me, and I'll take you to
see my patient."</p>

<p>"But what do you think of it all?" said Denzil,
eager for some comment.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that," rejoined Jorce, "when you
have heard the story of Mr. Vrain."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Lucian was led by his guide
into a pleasant room, with French windows opening
on to a wide verandah, and a sunny lawn set
round with flowers. Books were arranged on shelves
round the walls, newspapers and magazines were
on the table, and near the window, in a comfortable
chair, sat an old man with a volume in his hand.
As Jorce entered he stood up and shuffled forward
with a senile smile of delight. Evidently&mdash;and
with reason, poor soul&mdash;he considered the doctor
his very good friend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p><p>"Well, well!" said the cheery Jorce, "and how
are you to-day, Mr. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"I feel very well," replied Vrain in a soft, weak
voice. "Who is this, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"A young friend of mine, Mr. Vrain. He wishes
to hear your story."</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" sighed Vrain, his eyes filling with
tears, "a sad story, sir."</p>

<p>The father of Diana was of middle height, with
white hair, and a long white beard which swept his
chest. On his cheek Lucian saw the cicatrice of
which Diana had spoken, and mainly by which the
dead man had been falsely identified as Vrain. He
was very like Clear in figure and manner; but, of
course, the resemblance in the face was not very
close, as Clear had been clean shaven, whereas the
real Vrain wore a beard. The eyes were dim and
weak-looking, and altogether Lucian saw that Vrain
was not fitted to battle with the world in any way,
and quite weak enough to become the prey of villains,
as had been his sad fate.</p>

<p>"My name is Mark Vrain, young sir," said he,
beginning his story without further preamble. "I
lived in Berwin Manor, Bath, with my wife Lydia,
but she treated me badly by letting another man
love her, and I left her. Oh, yes, sir, I left her. I
went away to Salisbury, and was very happy there
with my books, but, alas! I took morph&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vrain!" said Jorce, holding up his finger, "no!"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," said the old man, with
a watery smile, "I mean I was very happy there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>But Signor Ferruci, a black-hearted villain"&mdash;his
face grew dark as he mentioned the name&mdash;"found
me out and made me come with him to London.
He kept me there for months, and then he brought
me here."</p>

<p>"Kept you where, Mr. Vrain?" asked Lucian
gently.</p>

<p>The old man looked at him with a vacant eye.
"I don't know," he said in a dull voice.</p>

<p>"You came here from Bayswater," hinted Jorce.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Bayswater!" cried Vrain, growing excited.
"I was there with a woman they called my
wife. She was not my wife! My wife is fair, this
woman was dark. Her name was Maud Clear:
my wife's name is Lydia."</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Clear say you were her husband,
Michael?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She called me Michael Clear, and brought
me to stay with the doctor. But I am not Michael
Clear!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>THE OTHER MAN'S WIFE</h3>


<p>As soon as Lucian arrived back in his rooms he
sat down at his desk and wrote a long letter to
Diana, giving a full account of his extraordinary
discovery of her father in Jorce's asylum, and advising
her to come up at once to London.</p>

<p>When he posted this&mdash;which he did the same
night&mdash;he sighed to think it was not a love letter.
He could have covered reams of paper with words
of passion and adoration; he could have poured out
his whole soul at the feet of his divinity, telling her
of his love, his aspirations, his hopes and fears.
No doubt, from a common-sense view, the letter
would have been silly enough, but it would have
relieved his mind and completed his happiness of
knowing that he loved and was beloved.</p>

<p>But in place of writing thus, he was compelled
by his promise to Diana to pen a description of
his late discovery, and interesting as the case was
now growing, he found it irksome to detail the incident
of the afternoon. He wished to be a lover,
not a detective.</p>

<p>So absent-minded and distraught was Lucian,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>that Miss Greeb, who had long suspected something
was wrong with him, spoke that very evening
about himself. She declared that Lucian was working
too hard, that he needed another rest, although
he had just returned from the country, and recommended
a sleeping draught. Finally she produced
a letter which had just arrived, and as it was in a
female hand, Miss Greeb watched its effect on her
admired lodger with the keen eyes of a jealous
woman. When she saw him flush and seize it eagerly,
casting, meanwhile, an impatient look on her
to leave the room, she knew the truth at once, and
retired hurriedly to the kitchen, where she shed
floods of tears.</p>

<p>"I might have guessed it," gasped Miss Greeb
to a comfortable cat which lay selfishly before the
fire. "He's far too good-looking not to be snapped
up. He'll be leaving me and setting up house with
that other woman. I only hope she'll do for him as
well as I have done. I wonder if she's beautiful
and rich. Oh, how dreadful it all is!" But the
cat made no comment on this tearful address&mdash;not
as much as a mew. It rolled over into a warmer
place and went to sleep again. Cats are particularly
selfish animals.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards Miss Greeb opened the
door to a tall and beautiful lady, who asked for
Mr. Denzil, and was shown into his sitting-room.
With keen instinct, Miss Greeb decided that this
was the woman who had taken possession of Lucian's
heart, and being a just little creature, in spite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>of her jealousy, was obliged to admit that the visitor
was as handsome as a picture. Then, seeing that
there was no chance for her beside this splendid
lady, she consoled herself with a dismal little proverb,
and looked forward to the time when it would
be necessary to put a ticket in the parlour window.
Meanwhile, to have some one on whose bosom she
could weep, Miss Greeb went round to see Mrs.
Bensusan, leaving Diana in possession of Lucian,
and the cat sole occupant of the kitchen.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, on the front floor, Diana,
with her eyes shining like two stars, was talking to
Lucian. She had come up at once on receipt of
his letter; she had been to Hampstead, she had
seen her father, and now she was telling Lucian
about the visit.</p>

<p>"He knew me at once, poor dear," she said rapidly,
"and asked me if I had been out, just as if
I'd left the house for a visit and come back. Ah!"&mdash;she
shook her head and sighed&mdash;"I am afraid
he'll never be quite himself again."</p>

<p>"What does Jorce think?"</p>

<p>"He says that father can be discharged as cured,
and is going to see about it for me. Of course,
he will never be quite sane, but he will never be
violent so long as morphia and drugs of that sort
are kept from him. As soon as he is discharged I
shall take him back to Bath, and put him in charge
of Miss Barbar; then I shall return to town, and
we must expose the whole conspiracy!"</p>

<p>"Conspiracy?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>"What else do you call it, Lucian? That woman
and Ferruci have planned and carried it out between
them. They put my father into the asylum,
and made another man pass as him, in order to get
the assurance money. As their tool did not die
quickly enough, they killed him."</p>

<p>"No, Diana. Both Lydia and Ferruci have
proved beyond all doubt that they were not in Pimlico
at the hour of the death. I believe they contrived
this conspiracy, but I don't believe they murdered
Clear."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see what defence they make. But
one thing is certain, Lucian&mdash;Lydia will have to
disgorge the assurance money."</p>

<p>"Yes, she certainly will, and I've no doubt the
Assurance Company will prosecute her for fraud
in obtaining it. I shall see Ferruci to-morrow and
force him to confess his putting your father in the
asylum."</p>

<p>"No!" said Diana, shaking her head. "Don't
do that until you have more evidence against him."</p>

<p>"I think the evidence of Jorce is strong enough.
I suppose you mean the evidence of Mrs. Clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes; although for her own sake I don't suppose
she will speak."</p>

<p>Lucian nodded. "I thought of that also," he
said, "and yesterday I went to St. Bertha Street,
Bayswater, to see her. But I found that she had
moved, and no one knew where she was. I expect,
having received her price for the conspiracy, she
has left London. However, I put an advertise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>ment
in the papers, saying if she called on me here
she would hear of something to her advantage. It
is in the papers this morning."</p>

<p>"I doubt if she will call," said Diana seriously.
"What about the promised revelation of Rhoda?"</p>

<p>"I believe that girl is deceiving me," cried Lucian
angrily. "I went round to Jersey Street, as she
asked me, and only saw Mrs. Bensusan, who said
that Rhoda was out and would not be back for some
time. Then I had to wait for you here and tell
you all about your father, so the thing slipped my
memory. I have not been near the place since, but
I'll go round there to-night. Whatever is Miss
Greeb thinking of?" cried Lucian, breaking off
quickly. "That front door bell has been ringing
for at least five minutes!"</p>

<p>To Diana's amusement, Lucian went and shouted
down the stairs to Miss Greeb, but as no reply
came, and the bell was still ringing furiously, he
was obliged to open the door himself. On the step
there stood a little woman in a tailor-made brown
frock, a plainly trimmed brown straw hat with a
black gauze velvet-spotted veil. At once Denzil
guessed who she was.</p>

<p>"You are Mrs. Clear?" he said, delighted that
she had replied so quickly to his advertisement, for
it had only that morning appeared in the newspapers.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," answered the woman, in a quick,
sharp voice. "Are you the L. D. who advertised
for me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p><p>"Yes. Come upstairs. I have much to say to you."</p>

<p>"Diana," said Lucian, on entering the room with
his prize, "let me introduce you to Mrs. Clear."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clear! Are you the wife of the man who
was murdered in the house opposite?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clear uttered a cry of astonishment, and
turned as if to retreat. But Denzil was between her
and the door, so she saw that there was nothing
for it but to outface the situation. As though she
found it difficult to breathe, she threw up her veil,
and Diana beheld a thin white face with two brilliant
black eyes.</p>

<p>"This is a trap," said Mrs. Clear, hoarsely, looking
from the one to the other. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I," said Lucian, politely, "I am the man who
met your husband before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My husband! I have my husband in an asylum.
You can't have met him!"</p>

<p>"You are telling a falsehood," said Diana fiercely.
"The gentleman in the asylum of Dr. Jorce is
not your husband, but my father!"</p>

<p>"Your father? And who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Diana Vrain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clear gave a screech, and dropped back on
to the sofa, staring at Diana with wide-open and
terrified eyes.</p>

<p>"And now, Mrs. Clear, I see you realise the situation,"
Lucian said coldly. "You must confess your
share in this conspiracy."</p>

<p>"What conspiracy?" she interrupted furiously.</p>

<p>"The putting of Mr. Vrain into an asylum, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>the passing off of your husband, Michael Clear, as
him."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"Come, now, you talk nonsense! If you refuse
to speak I'll have you arrested at once."</p>

<p>"Arrest me!" She bounded off the sofa with
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, on a charge of conspiracy. It is no use
your getting angry, Mrs. Clear, for it won't improve
your position. We&mdash;that is, this lady and
myself&mdash;wish to know, firstly, how your husband
came to be masquerading as Mr. Vrain; secondly,
where we can find the man called Wrent, who employed
your husband; and thirdly, Mrs. Clear, we
wish to know, and the law wishes to know, who
killed your husband."</p>

<p>"I don't know who killed him," said the woman,
looking rather afraid, "but I believe Wrent did."</p>

<p>"Who is Wrent?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know many things," said Diana, taking
part in the conversation, "but you must tell
us what you do know, otherwise I shall call in a
policeman and have you arrested."</p>

<p>"You can't prove anything against me."</p>

<p>"I think I can," said Lucian in the most cheerful
manner. "I can prove that you were in No. 13
of this Square, seeing your husband, for I found
on the fence dividing the back yard of that house
from one in Jersey Street a scrap of a veil such
as you wear. Also the landlady and servant can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>prove that you called on Mr. Wrent several times,
and were with him on the night of the murder. Then
there is the evidence of your cloak, which you left
behind, and which Wrent gave to the servant
Rhoda. Also the evidence of Signor Ferruci&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ferruci! What has he said about me?"</p>

<p>Lucian saw that revenge might make the woman
speak, so he lied in the calmest manner to get at
the truth. "Ferruci says that he contrived the
whole conspiracy."</p>

<p>"So he did," said Mrs. Clear, with a nod.</p>

<p>"And took you to 'The Haven,' at Hampstead,
on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>"That's true. He took me from Wrent's house
in Jersey Street. You need not go on, Mr. L. D.
I admit the whole business."</p>

<p>"You do?" cried Lucian and Diana together.</p>

<p>"Yes, if only to spite that old villain Wrent, who
has not paid me the money he promised."</p>

<p>Before Lucian and Miss Vrain could express
their pleasure at Mrs. Clear coming to this sensible
conclusion, the door opened suddenly, and little
Miss Greeb, in a wonderful state of agitation,
tripped in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Denzil! I've just been to Mrs. Bensusan's,
and Rhoda's run away!"</p>

<p>"Run away!"</p>

<p>"Yes! She hasn't been back all day, and left a
note for Mrs. Bensusan saying she was going to
hide, because she was afraid."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>A CONFESSION</h3>


<p>Now, indeed, Lucian had his hands full. Rhoda,
the red-headed servant of Mrs. Bensusan, had run
away on the plea that she was afraid of something&mdash;what
she did not explain in the note she left behind
her, and it was necessary that she should be
discovered, and forced into confessing what she
knew of the conspiracy and murder. Mrs. Clear,
not having been paid her hush money, had betrayed
the confidence and misdeeds of Ferruci, thereby revealing
an extent of villainy for which neither
Diana nor Lucian was prepared. Now the Count
had to be seen and brought to book for his doings,
Lydia informed that her husband was in the asylum,
and Vrain himself had to be released in due
form from his legal imprisonment. How Lucian,
even with the assistance of Diana, could deal with
all these matters, he did not know.</p>

<p>"Why not see Mr. Link?" suggested Diana,
when Mrs. Clear had departed, after making a
clean breast of the nefarious transactions in which
she had been involved. "He may take the case
in hand again."</p>

<p>"No doubt," responded Denzil drily, "but I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>not very keen to hand it over to him, seeing that he
has abandoned it twice. Again, if I call in the police,
it is all over with Lydia and the Count. They
will be arrested and punished."</p>

<p>"For the murder of Clear?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if it can be proved that they have
anything to do with it; certainly for the conspiracy
to get the assurance money by the feigned death of
your father."</p>

<p>"Well," said Diana coldly, "and why should they
not receive the reward of their deeds?"</p>

<p>"Quite so; but the question is, do you wish any
scandal?"</p>

<p>Diana was silent. She had not looked at the
matter from this point of view. It was true what
Lucian said. If the police took up the case again,
Lydia and her accomplice would be arrested, and
the whole sordid story of their doings would be in
the papers.</p>

<p>Diana was a proud woman, and winced at the
idea of such publicity. It would be as well to avoid
proceeding to such extremities. If the assurance
money was returned by Lydia, she would be reduced
to her former estate, and by timely flight
might escape the vengeance of the defrauded company.
After all, she was the wife of Vrain, and
little as Diana liked her, she did not wish to see
the woman who was so closely related to the
wronged man put in prison; not for her own sake,
but for the sake of the name she so unworthily
bore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"I leave it in your hands," said Diana to Lucian,
who was watching her closely.</p>

<p>"Very good," replied Denzil. "Then I think it
will be best for me to see Ferruci first, and hear
his confession; afterwards call on Mrs. Vrain, and
learn what she has to say. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Diana, curiously, "what then?"</p>

<p>"I will be guided by circumstances. In the meantime,
for the sake of your name, we had better keep
the matter as quiet as possible."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clear may speak out."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clear won't speak," said Denzil grimly.
"She will keep quiet for her own sake; and as
Rhoda has left Jersey Street, there will be no danger
of trouble from that quarter. First, I'll see
Lydia and the Count, to get to the bottom of this
conspiracy; then I'll set the police on Rhoda's track,
that she may be arrested and made to confess her
knowledge of the murder."</p>

<p>"Do you think she knows anything?"</p>

<p>"I think she knows everything," replied Lucian
with emphasis. "That is why she has run away.
If we capture her, and force her to speak, we may
be able to arrest Wrent."</p>

<p>"Why Wrent?" asked Diana.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten what Mrs. Clear said? I
agree with her that he is the assassin, although we
can't prove it as yet."</p>

<p>"But who is Wrent?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lucian, significantly, "that is just
what I wish to find out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The upshot of this interview was that early the
next morning Denzil went to the chambers of Ferruci,
in Marquis Street, and informed the servant
that he wanted particularly to see the Count.</p>

<p>At first the Italian, being still in bed&mdash;for he
was a late riser&mdash;did not incline to grant his visitor
an interview; but on second thoughts he ordered
Lucian to be shown into the sitting-room, and shortly
afterwards joined him there wrapped in a dressing-gown.
He welcomed the barrister with a smiling nod,
and having some instinct that Lucian came
on an unpleasant errand, he did not offer him his
hand. From the first the two men were on their
guard against one another.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, sir," said Ferruci in his best
English. "May I ask why you take me from my
bed so early?"</p>

<p>"To tell you a story."</p>

<p>"About my friend Dr. Jorce saying I was with
him on that night?" sneered the Count.</p>

<p>"Partly, and partly about a lady you know."</p>

<p>Ferruci frowned. "You speak of Mrs. Vrain?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Lucian coolly. "I speak of Mrs.
Clear."</p>

<p>At the mention of this name, which was the last
one he expected to hear his visitor pronounce, the
Italian, in spite of his coolness and cunning, could
not forbear a start.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clear?" he repeated. "And what do you
know of Mrs. Clear?"</p>

<p>"As much as Dr. Jorce could tell me, Count."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p><p>Ferruci's brow cleared. "Then you know I pay
for keeping her miserable husband with my friend,"
he said composedly. "It is for her sake I am so
kind."</p>

<p>"Rather it is for your own you are so cunning."</p>

<p>"Cunning! A most strange word for my goodness,"
said the Count coolly.</p>

<p>"The most fit word, you mean," replied Lucian,
impatient of this fencing. "It is no use beating
about the bush, Count. I know that the man you
keep in the asylum is not Clear, but Mark Vrain."</p>

<p>"La! la! la! You talk great humbug. Mr.
Vrain is dead and buried!"</p>

<p>"He is not dead," answered Lucian resolutely,
"and the man who was buried under his name is
Michael Clear, the husband of the woman who told
me all."</p>

<p>Ferruci, who had been pacing impatiently up and
down the room, stopped short, with a nervous
laugh.</p>

<p>"This is most amusing," he said, with an emotion
he could not conceal despite his self-control.
"Mrs. Clear told you all, eh? She told you what,
my friend?"</p>

<p>"That is the story I have come to tell you," replied
Lucian sharply.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Ferruci, with a shrug. "I
wait to hear this pretty story," and with a frown
he threw himself into a chair near Lucian. Apparently
he saw that he was found out, for it took
him all his time to keep his voice from trembling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>and his hands from shaking. The man was not a
coward, but being thus brought face to face with
a peril he little expected, it was scarcely to be wondered
at that he felt shaken and nervous. Moreover,
he knew little about the English law, and
hardly guessed how his misdeeds would be punished.
Still, he did not surrender on the spot, but
listened quietly to Lucian's story, in the hope of
seeing some way of escape from his awkward position.</p>

<p>"The other day I went to Dr. Jorce's asylum,"
said Lucian slowly, "and there I discovered&mdash;it
matters not how&mdash;that your friend Clear was Mr.
Vrain; also I learned that he had been placed in
the asylum by you and Mrs. Clear. Jorce gave me
her address in Bayswater, but when I went there
I could not find her; she had left. I then put an
advertisement in all the papers, stating that if she
called on me she would hear of something to her
advantage. Now, Count, it appears that Mrs. Clear
was in the habit of looking into the papers to see
if there was any message from yourself, or your
friend Wrent, so she saw my advertisement at once,
and came in person to reply to it."</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Denzil," said Ferruci politely.
"I know no one called Wrent, and he is
not my friend."</p>

<p>"We'll come to that hereafter," answered Lucian,
with a shrug. "In the meantime I'll proceed
with my story, which I see interests you very much.
Well, Count, it seems that Michael Clear was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>actor, who bore a strong resemblance to Mr. Vrain,
save that he had not a scar on his face. Vrain, at
Bath, was always clean shaven; now he wears a long
white beard, but that is neither here nor there. Clear
had a moustache, but when that was shaved off he
looked exactly like Vrain. For purposes of your
own, which you can easily guess, you made the acquaintance
of this man, a profligate and a drunkard,
and proposed, for a certain sum of money to be paid
to his wife, that he, Michael Clear, should personate
Vrain and live in the Silent House in Geneva
Square, under the name of Berwin. You knew
that Clear was slowly dying of consumption and
drink, so you trusted that he would die as Vrain;
that Mrs. Vrain&mdash;who I believe is in the plot&mdash;would
recognise the corpse by the description in
the newspapers; and that, when Clear was buried
as Vrain, she would get the assurance money and
marry you."</p>

<p>"That is clever," said the Count, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"But is it true?"</p>

<p>"You know best," answered Lucian, coolly.
"However, all turned out as you expected, for Clear
died as Vrain&mdash;or rather was murdered at your
command, as he did not die quickly enough&mdash;his
body was recognised by Mrs. Vrain, buried as her
husband, and she got the assurance money. The
only thing that remains for your conspiracy to be
entirely successful is that Mrs. Vrain should marry
you; and&mdash;as I was told by Mr. Clyne&mdash;that has
pretty well been arranged."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p><p>"Do you think, then, that Clyne would let his
daughter marry a man who has done all this?" said
Ferruci, who was now very pale.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Clyne knows anything about it,"
replied Lucian coldly. "You and Mrs. Vrain made
up this pretty plot between you. Vrain himself told
me how you decoyed him from Salisbury, and took
him to Mrs. Clear's, in Bayswater, where he passed
as her husband, although, as she confesses, she kept
him as a kind of prisoner."</p>

<p>"But this is wrong," cried Ferruci, trying to
laugh. "This is most foolish. How would a man,
of his own will, pass as the husband of a woman he
knew not?"</p>

<p>"A sane man would not; but none knew better
than you, Count, that Vrain was not sane, and that
you dosed him with drugs, and let Mrs. Clear keep
him locked up in her house until you put him in
the asylum. Vrain was a puppet in your hands, and
you locked him up in an asylum a fortnight after
the man who personated him was murdered. You
intended to marry Mrs. Vrain and keep her wretched
husband in that asylum all his life."</p>

<p>"The best place for a lunatic," said Ferruci.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Lucian. "Then you admit that
that Vrain was mad?"</p>

<p>"I admit nothing, not even that he is alive. If
what you say is true," said the Italian, cunningly,
"how came it that the murdered man had the scar
on his cheek? He might have been like Vrain, eh,
but not so much."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p><p>"Mrs. Clear explained that," replied Lucian
quickly. "You made that scar, Count, with vitriol,
or some such stuff. You don't know chemistry for
nothing, I see."</p>

<p>"I am quite ignorant of chemistry," said Ferruci
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Jorce heard a different story in Florence."</p>

<p>"In Florence! Did Jorce ask about me there?"
said the Count in alarm.</p>

<p>"He did, and heard some strange tales, Count.
Come, now, it is no use your trying to evade this
matter further. Jorce can prove that you put Vrain
into his asylum under the name of Clear. Miss
Vrain can prove that the so-called Clear is her father,
and Mrs. Clear&mdash;who has turned Queen's evidence&mdash;has
exposed the whole of your conspiracy.
The game's up, Count."</p>

<p>Ferruci sprang from his seat and began to walk
hastily up and down the room. He looked haggard
and pale, and years older, as he recognised his position,
for he saw very plainly that he was trapped,
and that nothing remained to him but flight. But
how to fly? He stopped opposite to Lucian.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" he demanded in
a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"Have you arrested, along with Mrs. Vrain,"
replied Lucian, making this threat to force Ferruci
into defending himself or confessing.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vrain is innocent&mdash;she knows nothing
about this conspiracy, as you call it. I planned the
whole thing myself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p><p>"You admit, then, that the so-called Vrain was
really Michael Clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I got him to personate the man Vrain, so
that I could get the assurance money when I married
Lydia. I chose Clear because he was like
Vrain. I made the scar on the cheek, and I thought
he would die soon, being consumptive."</p>

<p>"And you killed him?"</p>

<p>"No! No! I swear I did not kill him!"</p>

<p>"Did you not take that stiletto from Berwin
Manor?"</p>

<p>"No! I never did! I am telling the truth! I
do not know who killed Clear."</p>

<p>"Did you not visit Wrent in Jersey Street?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was the man Rhoda saw in the back
yard. I was waiting for Mrs. Clear, to take her
to Hampstead; and in the meantime I thought I
would climb over the fence and see Clear. But
the girl saw me, so I ran away, and joined Mrs.
Clear up the road. I was not aware at the time
that the woman who saw me was Rhoda. Afterwards
I went to Hampstead with Mrs. Clear, to see
Jorce."</p>

<p>"Did you buy the cloak?"</p>

<p>"I did. That girl in Baxter &amp; Co.'s told a lie
for me. I was warned by Mrs. Vrain that you
had made questions about the cloak, so I went to the
girl and told her you were a jealous husband, and
paid her to say it was not I who bought the cloak.
She did so, quite ignorant of the real reason I
wished her to deny knowing me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p><p>"Why did you buy the cloak?" asked Lucian,
satisfied with this explanation.</p>

<p>"I bought it for Wrent. He asked me to buy it,
but what he wanted it for I do not know. He had
it some days before Christmas, and, I believe, gave
it to Mrs. Clear, and afterwards to the girl Rhoda.
But of this I am not sure."</p>

<p>"Who is Wrent?" asked Denzil, reserving the
most important question for the last.</p>

<p>"Wrent?" said Ferruci, smiling in a sneering
way. "Ah! you wish to know who Wrent is?
Well, excuse me for a few minutes, and I'll bring
you something to show who he is."</p>

<p>With a nod to Lucian he passed into his bedroom,
leaving the barrister much astonished. He
thought that Ferruci was Wrent himself, and had
gone away to resume the disguise of wig and beard.
While he pondered thus the Count reappeared, carrying
a small bottle in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Denzil," said he, with a ghastly smile, "I
have played a bold game, and, thanks to a woman's
treachery, I have lost. I hoped to get twenty thousand
pounds and a charming wife; but I have
gained nothing but poverty and a chance of imprisonment;
but I am of noble birth, and I will not
survive my dishonour. You wish to know who
Wrent is&mdash;you shall never know."</p>

<p>He raised the bottle to his lips before Lucian,
motionless with horror, could rush forward, and
the next moment Count Ercole Ferruci was lying
dead on the floor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THE NAME OF THE ASSASSIN</h3>


<p>That afternoon London was ringing with the
news of Ferruci's suicide; but no paper could give
any reason for the rash act. This inability was
due to the police, who, anxious to capture those
concerned in the conspiracy to obtain the assurance
money of the Sirius Company, kept everything they
could out of the papers, lest Lydia and Wrent
should be put on their guard, and so escape.</p>

<p>Lucian had been forced to report the death of
Ferruci to the authorities. Now the case was out
of his hands again, and in those of Link, who
blamed the young barrister severely for not having
brought him into the matter before. The detective
was always more prone to blame than to praise.</p>

<p>"But what could I do?" cried Lucian angrily.
"You threw up the case twice! You said the assassin
of Clear&mdash;or, as you thought, Vrain&mdash;would
never be discovered!"</p>

<p>"I did my best, and failed," retorted Link, who
did not like his position. "You have had better luck
and have succeeded."</p>

<p>"My luck has been sheer hard work, Link. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>was not so faint-hearted as you, to draw back at the
first check."</p>

<p>"Well, well, the whole truth hasn't been discovered
yet, Mr. Denzil. As you have found out this
conspiracy, I may learn who the assassin is."</p>

<p>"We know that already. The assassin is Wrent."</p>

<p>"You have yet to prove that."</p>

<p>"I?" said Lucian, with disdain. "I prove nothing.
I wash my hands of the whole affair. You
are a detective; let me see what you will make of
a case which has baffled you twice!" and Denzil,
with rage in his heart, went off, laughing at the
discomfiture of Link.</p>

<p>At that moment the detective hated his successful
rival with his whole heart.</p>

<p>Lucian took a hansom to the Royal John Hotel
in Kensington, where Diana, in a great state of
alarm, was reading the evening papers, which contained
short notices of Ferruci's death. On seeing
her lover, she hurried forward anxiously and caught
him by the hand.</p>

<p>"Lucian, I am so glad you have come!" she cried,
leading him to a chair. "I sent messages both to
Geneva Square and Sergeant's Inn, but you were
neither at your lodgings nor in your office."</p>

<p>"I was better employed, my dear," said Lucian,
with a weary sigh, for he was quite worn out with
fatigue and anxiety. "I have been with Link, telling
him about Ferruci's death, and being blamed as the
cause of it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"You blamed! And why?" said Diana, with
just indignation.</p>

<p>"Because I forced Ferruci to confess the truth,
and when he saw that there was every chance of his
being put into jail for his villainy, he went to his
bedroom and took poison. You know, Mrs. Clear
said the man was something of a chemist, so I suppose
he prepared the poison himself. It was very
swift in its action, for he dropped dead before I
could recover my presence of mind."</p>

<p>"Lucian! this is terrible!" cried Diana, wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>"You may well say that," he replied gloomily.
"Now the whole details of the case will be in the
papers, and that unfortunate woman will be arrested."</p>

<p>"Lydia! And what will her father say? It will
break his heart!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but he must take the consequences of
having brought up his daughter so badly. Still,"
added Lucian, reflectively, "I do not believe that
Lydia is so guilty as Wrent. That scoundrel seems
to be at the bottom of the affair. Ferruci and he
contrived and carried out the whole thing between
them, and a precious pair of villains they are."</p>

<p>"Will Wrent be arrested?"</p>

<p>"If he can be found; but I fancy the scoundrel
has made himself scarce out of fright. Since he
left Jersey Street, after the murder, he has not been
heard of. Even Mrs. Clear does not know where
he is. You know she has put advertisements in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>papers in the cypher he gave her&mdash;according to the
arrangement between them&mdash;but Wrent has not
turned up."</p>

<p>"And Rhoda?"</p>

<p>"Rhoda is still missing. The police are getting
warrants out for the servant, for Wrent, for Mrs.
Clear, and for Lydia Vrain. Ferruci, luckily for
himself and his family, has escaped the law by his
own act. It was the wisest thing the scoundrel
could do to kill himself and avoid dishonour. I
must admit the man had pluck."</p>

<p>"It is terrible! terrible! What will be the end
of it?"</p>

<p>"Imprisonment for the lot, I expect, unless they
can prove that Wrent murdered Clear; then they
will hang him. But now that Ferruci is dead, I
fancy Rhoda is the only witness who can prove
Wrent's guilt. That is why she ran away. I don't
wonder she was afraid to stay. But I feel quite
worn out with all this, Diana. Please give me a
biscuit and a glass of port; I have had nothing all
day."</p>

<p>With a sigh, Diana touched the bell, and when
the waiter made his appearance gave the order. She
felt low-spirited and nervous, in spite of the discovery
that her father was alive and well; and indeed
the extraordinary events of the last few days
were sufficient to upset the strongest mind.</p>

<p>Lucian was leaning back in his chair with closed
eyes, for his head was aching with the excitement
of the morning. Suddenly he opened them and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>jumped up. At the same time Diana threw open
the door with an exclamation, and both of them
heard the thin, high voice of a woman, who apparently
was coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Never mind my name," said the voice, "I'll tell
it to Miss Vrain myself. Take me to her at once."</p>

<p>"Lydia!" called Lucian, "and here? Great heavens!
Why does she come here?"</p>

<p>Diana said nothing, but compressed her lips as
Lydia, followed by the waiter with the biscuits and
wine, came into the room. She was plainly and
neatly dressed, and wore a heavy veil, but seemed
greatly excited. She did not say a word, nor did
Diana, until the waiter left the room and closed the
door. Then she threw up her veil, revealing a haggard
face and red eyes, swollen with weeping, and
filled with an expression of terror.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive! isn't this awful?" she wailed, making
a clutch at Miss Vrain's arm. "You've done
it, this time, Diana. Ferruci's dead, and your father
alive, and I'm not a widow, and my father away
I don't know where! I was told that the police
were after me, so I'm clearing out."</p>

<p>"Clearing out, Mrs. Vrain?" repeated Diana,
stiffly.</p>

<p>"I should think so!" sobbed Lydia. "I don't
want to stay and be put in gaol, though what I've
done to be put in gaol for, I don't know."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Lucian indignantly. "You don't
know&mdash;when this abominable conspiracy is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p><p>"I know nothing of the conspiracy," interrupted
Lydia.</p>

<p>"Did you not get Ferruci to put your husband
into an asylum?"</p>

<p>"I? I did nothing of the sort. I thought my
husband was dead and buried until Ferruci told me
the truth, and then I held my tongue until I could
think of what to do. After Ercole died, his servant
came round and told me all&mdash;he overheard
the conversation you had with the Count, Mr.
Denzil. I was never so astonished in my life as to
hear about Mrs. Clear and her husband&mdash;and
Mark alive&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, Lord! isn't it dreadful?
Give me a glass of wine, Diana, or I'll go
right off in a dead faint!"</p>

<p>In silence Miss Vrain poured out a glass of port
and handed it to her stepmother, who sipped it in a
most tearful mood. Lucian looked at the wretched
little woman without saying a word, and wondered
if, indeed, she was as innocent as she made herself
out to be. He thought that, after all, she might
be ignorant of Ferruci's plots, although she had
certainly benefited by them; but she was such a glib
liar that he did not know how much to believe of
her story. However, she had hitherto only given
a general idea of her connection with the matter,
so when she had finished her wine, and was somewhat
calmer, Lucian begged her to be more explicit.</p>

<p>"Did you know&mdash;did you guess, or even suspect&mdash;that
your husband was alive?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Denzil," said Lydia, with unusual solemnity,
"as I'm a married woman, and not the widow
I thought I was, I did not know that Mark was
alive! I'm bad, I daresay, but I am not bad enough
to shut a man up in a lunatic asylum and pretend
he is dead, just to get money, much as I like it.
What I did about identifying the corpse was done
in good faith."</p>

<p>"You really thought it was my father's body?"
questioned Diana doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I swear I did," responded Mrs. Vrain, emphatically.
"Mark walked out of the house because
he thought I was carrying on with Ferruci, which
I wasn't. It was that Tyler cat who made the trouble
between us, and Mark was so weak and silly&mdash;half
crazy, I think, with his morphia and over-study&mdash;that
he cleared right out, and I never knew where
he had gone to. When I saw that notice about the
murdered man in Geneva Square, who called himself
Berwin, and was marked on the cheek, I
thought he might be my husband. When the coffin
was opened, I really believed I saw poor Mark's
dead body. The face was just like his, and scarred
in the same way."</p>

<p>"What about the missing finger, Mrs. Vrain? If
I remember, you even gave a cause for its loss."</p>

<p>"Well, it was this way," replied Lydia, somewhat
discomposed. "I knew that Mark hadn't lost
a finger when he left, but Ferruci said that if I denied
it the police might refuse to believe that the
body was that of my husband. So, as I was sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
it was Mark's corpse, I just said he had lost a finger
out West. I didn't think there was any harm
in saying so, as for all I knew he might have got it
chopped off after leaving me. But the face of the
dead man was&mdash;as I thought&mdash;Mark's, and he
called himself Berwin, which, you know, Diana, is
the name of the Manor, and the scar was on the
cheek. I know now it was all contrived by Ercole;
but then I was quite ignorant."</p>

<p>"When did you find out the truth?"</p>

<p>"After that cloak business. Ferruci came to me,
and I told him what that girl at Baxter's had said,
and insisted that he should tell me the truth. Well,
he did, in order to force me to marry him, and then
I told him to go and make it right with the girl,
so that when Mr. Denzil went again she'd deny that
Ercole had bought the cloak."</p>

<p>"She denied it, sure enough," said Lucian grimly.
"Ferruci, before he died, told me he had bribed her
to speak falsely. What more did the Count reveal
to you, Mrs. Vrain?&mdash;the conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He said he'd found Mark hiding at Salisbury,
half mad with morphia, and had taken him
up to Mrs. Clear's, where it seems he went mad
altogether, so they locked him up as her husband
in a lunatic asylum. Ferruci also told me that he
had seen Michael Clear on the stage, and that as
he was so like Mark, and was likely to die of drink
and consumption, he got him to play the part of
Mark in Geneva Square, under the name of Berwin.
Mrs. Clear visited her husband there by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>climbing over a back fence, and getting down a
cellar, somehow."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Lucian. "It was Mrs.
Clear's shadow I saw on the blind. She was fighting
with her husband, and when I rang the bell they
were both so alarmed that they left the house by
the back way and got into Jersey Street. Then
Mrs. Clear went home, and the man himself came
round into the Square by the front way. That was
how I met him. I wondered how people were in
the house during his absence. Mrs. Clear told me
all."</p>

<p>"Did she say why her husband made you examine
the house?" asked Diana.</p>

<p>"No. But I expect he made me do so that I
should not have my suspicions about that back entrance.
But, Mrs. Vrain, when Ferruci confessed
that your husband was alive, why did you not tell it
to the world?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd got the assurance money, you see,"
said Lydia, with shrewd candour, "and I thought
the company would make a fuss and take it back&mdash;as
I suppose they will now. Ferruci wanted me to
marry him, but I wasn't so bad as that. I did not
want to commit bigamy. But I really held my
tongue because Ferruci told me who killed Clear."</p>

<p>"He knew, then?" cried Lucian, "and denied it
to me! Who killed the man?"</p>

<p>"Wrent did&mdash;the man who lived in Jersey
Street."</p>

<p>"And who is at the bottom of the whole plot!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>said Lucian furiously. "Do you know where he
is to be found?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lydia boldly, "I do; but I'm not going
to tell where he is!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want him punished."</p>

<p>"But I do," said Diana angrily. "He is a wretch
who ought to suffer!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Lydia, loudly and spitefully,
"then make him suffer, for this Wrent is your own
father! It was Mark who killed Michael Clear!"</p>

<h3>LINK SETS A TRAP</h3>


<p>In the course of their acquaintance, Diana had
put up with a great deal from the little American
adventuress, owing to her position of stepmother,
but when she heard her accusing the man she had
ruined of murder, the patience of Miss Vrain gave
way. She rose quickly, and walking over to where
Lydia was shrinking in her chair, towered in righteous
indignation above the shameless little woman.</p>

<p>"You lie, Mrs. Vrain!" she said in a low, distinct
voice, with a flushed face and indignation in
her eyes. "You know you lie!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I only repeat what Ferruci told me," whimpered
Lydia, rather alarmed by the attitude of her
stepdaughter. "I'm sure I hope Mark didn't kill
the man, but Ercole said that he was in Jersey
Street for that purpose."</p>

<p>"It is not true! My father was in the asylum
at Hampstead!"</p>

<p>"Indeed he wasn't&mdash;not at the time Clear was
killed!" protested Lydia. "He was not put into
the asylum until at least two weeks after Christmas.
Is that not so, Mr. Denzil?"</p>

<p>"It is so," assented Lucian gravely, "but even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>admitting so much, it is impossible to believe that
Mr. Vrain was in Jersey Street. For many months
before Christmas he was in charge of Mrs. Clear,
at Bayswater."</p>

<p>"So Ercole said," replied Lydia, "but he used
to get away from Mrs. Clear at times, and had to
be brought back."</p>

<p>"He wandered when he got the chance," said
Lucian, with hesitation. "I admit as much."</p>

<p>"Well, then, when he was not at Bayswater he
used to live in Jersey Street as Wrent. Ferruci
found him out there, and tried to get him to go
back, and he took Mrs. Clear several times to the
same place in order to persuade him to return to
Bayswater. That was why Mrs. Clear visited Jersey
Street. Oh, Mark played his part there as Mr.
Wrent, I guess; there ain't no two questions about
that," finished Lydia triumphantly. "He is the
assassin, you bet!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" cried Diana furiously.
"Why, my father is too weak in the head to have
the will, let alone the courage, to masquerade like
that. He is like a child in leading-strings."</p>

<p>"That's his cunning, Diana. He's 'cute enough
to pretend madness, so that he won't be hanged!"</p>

<p>"It is impossible that Vrain can be Wrent," said
Lucian decidedly. "I agree with Miss Vrain; he
is too weak and irresponsible to carry out such a
deed. Besides, I don't see how you prove him
guilty of the murder; you do not even know that
he could enter the Silent House by the secret way."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p><p>"I don't know anything about it, except what
Count Ferruci told me," said Lydia obstinately.
"And he said that Vrain, as Wrent, killed Clear.
But you can easily prove if it's true or not."</p>

<p>"How can we prove it?" asked Diana coldly.</p>

<p>"By laying a trap for Mark. You know&mdash;at
least Ercole told me, and I suppose Mrs. Clear told
you&mdash;that she corresponded with Mark&mdash;Wrent, I
mean&mdash;in the agony column of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p>"By means of a cypher? Yes, I know that, but
she hasn't received any answer yet."</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied Lydia, with triumph,
"because Wrent&mdash;that's Mark, you know&mdash;is in the
asylum, and can't answer her."</p>

<p>"This is all nonsense!" broke in Lucian, impatient
of this cobweb spinning. "I don't believe a
word of Ferruci's story. If Vrain lived in Jersey
Street as Wrent, why should Mrs. Clear visit him?"</p>

<p>"To get him back to Bayswater."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! nonsense! And even admitting as
much, why should Mrs. Clear, in the newspapers,
correspond in cypher with a man whom she not
only knows is in an asylum as her husband, but who
can be seen by her at any time?"</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Lucian," cried Diana
emphatically. "Count Ferruci told a pack of falsehoods
to Mrs. Vrain! The thing is utterly absurd!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess I'm not so easily made a fool of
as all that!" cried Lydia, firing up. "If you don't
believe me, lay the trap I told you of. Let Mark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>go free out of the asylum; get Mrs. Clear, with
her cypher and newspapers, to ask him to meet her
in the house where Clear was murdered, and then
you'll see if Mark won't turn up in his character of
Wrent."</p>

<p>"He will not!" cried Diana vehemently. "He
will not!"</p>

<p>"Mark, when he left me," went on the angry
Lydia, "had plenty of hair, and was clean shaven.
Now&mdash;as Ferruci told me, for I haven't seen him&mdash;he
is bald, and wears a skull-cap of black velvet,
and a white beard. After Ercole told me about
Jersey Street I went there to ask that fat woman
about Mark; she said he had gone away two days
after Christmas, and described him as an old man
with a skull-cap and a white beard."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Lucian, for he recollected that
Rhoda gave the same description.</p>

<p>"Ah! you know I speak the truth!" said Lydia,
rising, "but I've had enough of all this. I've lost
my money, and I don't suppose I'll go back to
Mark. I've been treated badly all round, and I
don't know what poppa will say. But I'm going
out of London to meet him."</p>

<p>"You said you did not know where your father
was!" cried Diana scornfully.</p>

<p>"I don't tell you everything, Diana," retorted
Lydia, looking very wicked, "but, if you must know,
poppa went over to Paris last week, and I'm going
over there to meet him. He'll raise Cain for the
way I've been treated."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p><p>"Well," said Lucian, as she prepared to take her
leave, "I hope you'll get away."</p>

<p>"Do you intend to stop me, Mr. Denzil?" flashed
out Mrs. Vrain, furiously.</p>

<p>"Not I; but I'll give you a hint&mdash;the railway
stations will be watched by the police."</p>

<p>"For me?" said Lydia, with a scared expression.
"Oh, sakes! it's awful! and I've done nothing. It's
not my fault if I got the assurance money. I really
thought that Mark was dead. But I'll try and get
away to poppa; he'll put things right. Good-bye,
Mr. Denzil, and Diana; you've done me a heap of
harm, but I don't bear malice," and Mrs. Vrain
rushed out of the room in a great hurry to escape
the chance of arrest hinted at by Lucian. She had
a sharp eye to her own safety.</p>

<p>Diana waited until the cab which Lydia had kept
waiting was driving away, and then turned with
an anxious expression on her face to look at Lucian.
"My dear," she said, taking his arm, "what do you
think of Lydia's accusation?"</p>

<p>"Against your father?" said Lucian. "Why, I
don't believe it!"</p>

<p>"Nor do I; but it will be as well to set the trap
she suggests; for if my father does not fall into it&mdash;and
as he is not Wrent, I don't believe he will&mdash;the
real man may keep the appointment with Mrs.
Clear."</p>

<p>"Whosoever Wrent is, I don't think he'll come
again to the Silent House," replied the barrister,
shaking his head. "It would be thrusting his head
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>into the lion's jaws. If he is in London he'll see
the death of Ferruci described in the papers, and
no doubt will guess that the game is up; so he'll
keep away."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we'll do as Lydia suggests," said
Diana obstinately. "You see Mr. Link and Mrs.
Clear, and arrange about the cypher. Then my
father is to be discharged as cured to-morrow, and
I'll let him go out if he pleases. Of course, I'll
follow him; then I'll be able to see if he goes to
Pimlico."</p>

<p>"But, Diana, suppose he does go to the Silent
House, and proves to be Wrent?"</p>

<p>"He won't do that, my dear. My father is no
more Wrent than you are. I believe Lydia speaks
in the full belief that he is; but Ferruci, for his
own ends, lied to her. However, to trap the real
man, let us do as Lydia suggests. The idea is a
good one."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll try," said Lucian, with a sigh. "But
I do hope, Diana, that this case will end soon. Every
week there is some fresh development in a new direction,
and I am getting quite bewildered over it."</p>

<p>"It will end with the capture of Wrent, the assassin."</p>

<p>"I hope so; and God grant Wrent does not prove
to be your father!"</p>

<p>"There is no fear of that," said Diana gravely.
"My father is insane more or less, but he is not a
murderer. I am quite content to risk the trap suggested
by that woman."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucian did not at once adopt the plan to net
Wrent&mdash;whosoever he might be&mdash;invented by
Lydia, and approved of by Diana. On the whole,
he could not bring himself to believe that a weak-headed,
foolish old creature like Vrain had masqueraded
in Jersey Street as Wrent. Still there
were certain suspicious incidents which fitted in very
neatly with Ferruci's story. Mrs. Clear had stated
that Vrain, when under her charge, escaped several
times, and had remained away for several days,
until brought back again by the Count. Again, the
appearance of Wrent, as described by Rhoda, was
precisely the same as the looks of Vrain when Lucian
saw him in the Hampstead asylum; so it
seemed that there might be some truth in the story.</p>

<p>"But it's impossible!" said Lucian to himself.
"Vrain is half mad and incapable of conducting
his own life, or arranging so cleverly to commit a
crime. Also he had no money, and, had he lived
in Jersey Street, would not have been able to pay
Mrs. Bensusan. There is something more in the
coincidence of this similarity of looks than meets
the eye. I'll see Link and hear what he has to
say on the subject. It's time he found out something."</p>

<p>The next day Lucian paid a visit to Link, but
was not received very amiably by that gentleman,
who proved to be in a somewhat bad temper. He
was not altogether pleased with Lucian finding out
more about the case than he had discovered himself,
and also&mdash;to further ruffle his temper&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>clever Lydia had given him the slip. He had called
at her Mayfair house with a warrant for her arrest,
only to find out that&mdash;having received timely warning
from Ferruci's servant&mdash;she had fled. In vain
the railway stations had been watched. Lydia,
taking the hint given to her by Lucian, had baffled
that peril by taking the Dover train at a station outside
London.</p>

<p>Lucian heard what Link had to say on the subject,
but did not reveal the fact that Lydia had paid
a visit to Diana, or had gone to meet her father
at Dover. He did not want to give the little woman
up to justice, as he was beginning to believe her
innocent; and that, in all truth, she had known
nothing of the Ferruci-Wrent conspiracy.</p>

<p>Therefore, giving no information to Link as to
the little woman's whereabouts, Denzil told&mdash;as
coming from himself&mdash;his idea that Wrent might
fall into a trap set for him in the Pimlico House
by means of Mrs. Clear's cypher. Link listened to
the tale attentively, and decided to adopt the idea.</p>

<p>"It is a good one," he admitted generously, "and
I'm not jealous enough to cut off my nose to spite
my face. You have had the better of me all through
this case, Mr. Denzil, and we have had words over
it; but I'll show you that I can appreciate your cleverness
by adopting your plan."</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged to you for your good opinion,"
said Lucian drily, for he saw with some humour
that Link was only too anxious to benefit by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>the very cleverness of which he pretended to be
so jealous. "And you will see Mrs. Clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll see her at once, and get her to invite
Wrent to Pimlico by that cypher, with a threat that
she will betray the whole plot if he does not come."</p>

<p>"I daresay he knows already that Mrs. Clear is
a traitress?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" replied Link quickly. "I have
kept Mrs. Clear's name out of the papers. It is
known that Ferruci is dead, and that Mrs. Vrain is
likely to be arrested in connection with her supposed
husband's murder. But the fact of Mrs.
Clear putting the real Vrain into the asylum is not
known, nor, indeed, anything about the woman.
If Wrent thinks she'll tell tales, he'll meet her in
their own hunting grounds in Geneva Square, to
make his terms. Hitherto he has not replied to
her requests for money, but now he'll think she is
driven into a corner, and will fix her up once and
for all."</p>

<p>"Do you think that Wrent is Vrain?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! no!" replied Link, staring. "What
put that into your head?"</p>

<p>Lucian immediately told about the supposed connection
between Vrain and Wrent, but, suppressing
that it was Lydia's or Ferruci's idea, based his supposition
on the fact of the resemblance between the
two men. Link heard the theory with scorn, and
scouted the idea that the two men could be one and
the same.</p>

<p>"I've seen Vrain," said he. "The old man is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>as mad as a March hare and as silly as a child.
He's in his dotage, and could not possibly carry out
such a plan. But we can easily learn the truth."</p>

<p>"From whom?" asked Lucian.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Denzil, you are not so clever as you
think yourself," scoffed Link. "Why, from Mrs.
Clear, to be sure. She visited at Jersey Street, and
saw Wrent, and as Vrain was then with her in the
character of her husband, she'll be able to tell us
if they are two men or one person."</p>

<p>"You are right, Link. I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"He! he! Then I can still teach you something,"
replied Link, in high good humour at having for
once scored off the too clever barrister, and forthwith
went off to see Mrs. Clear.</p>

<p>How this interview with that lady sped, or what
she told him, he refused to reveal to Lucian; but its
result was that a cypher appeared in the agony column
of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, calling upon Wrent
to meet her in the Silent House in Pimlico, under
the penalty of her telling the police all she knew if
he did not come. In the same issue of the paper in
which this message appeared there was a paragraph
stating that Mrs. Vrain had been arrested at Dover.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>WHO FELL INTO THE TRAP?</h3>


<p>However closely one may study the fair sex,
there is no understanding them in the least. No
one can say how a woman will act in a given situation;
for feminine actions are based less on logical
foundations than on the emotion of the moment.</p>

<p>Diana had never liked Lydia; when the American
girl became her stepmother she hated her, and
not only said as much but showed in her every action
that she believed what she said. She declared that
she would be glad to see Lydia deprived of her
money and put into jail! The punishment would be
no more than she deserved.</p>

<p>Yet when these things came to pass; when, by the
discovery that Vrain yet lived, Lydia lost her liberty;
and when, as connected with the conspiracy,
she was arrested on a criminal warrant and
put into prison, Diana was the only friend
she had. Miss Vrain declared that her stepmother
was innocent, visited her in prison, and
engaged a lawyer to defend her. Lucian could not
forbear pointing out the discrepancy between
Diana's past sentiments and her present actions; but
Miss Vrain was quite ready with an excuse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p><p>"I am only doing my duty," she said. "In herself
I like Lydia as little as ever I did, but I think
we have suspected her wrongly in being connected
with this conspiracy, so I wish to help her if possible.
And after all," added Diana, "she is my
father's wife," as if that fact extenuated all.</p>

<p>"He has reason to know it," replied Lucian bitterly.
"If it had not been for Lydia, your father
would not have left his home for a lunatic asylum,
nor would Clear have been murdered."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Lucian; but some good
has come out of this evil, for if things had not been
as they are, you and I would never have met."</p>

<p>"Egad! that is true!" said Lucian, kissing her.
"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good."</p>

<p>So Diana played the part of a Good Samaritan
towards her stepmother, and helped her to bear the
evil of being thrust into prison. Lydia wrote to
her father in Paris, but received no reply, and therefore
was without a friend in the world save Diana.
Later on she was admitted to bail, and Diana
took her to the hotel in Kensington, there to wait
for the arrival of Mr. Clyne. His absence and
silence were both unaccountable.</p>

<p>"I hope nothing is wrong with poppa," wept
Lydia. "As a rule, he is always smart in replying,
and if he has seen about Ercole's death and my imprisonment
in the papers, I'm sure he will be over
soon."</p>

<p>While she was thus waiting for her father, and
Link in every way was seeking evidence against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>her, Mrs. Clear received an answer to her message.
In the same column of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and in
the same cypher, there appeared a message from
Wrent that he would meet Mrs. Clear at No. 13
Geneva Square.</p>

<p>Link was delighted when Mrs. Clear showed
him this, and rubbed his hands with much pleasure.
Affairs were about to be brought to a crisis, and
as Link was the moving spirit in the matter, his
vanity was sufficiently gratified as to make him quite
amiable.</p>

<p>"We've got him this time, Mr. Denzil," he said,
with enthusiasm. "You and I and a couple of policemen
will go down to that house in Geneva
Square&mdash;by the front, sir, by the front."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clear, also?" questioned Lucian, wishing
to be enlightened on all points.</p>

<p>"No. She'll come in by the back, down the cellarway,
as Wrent expects her to come. Then he'll
follow in the same path and walk right into the
trap."</p>

<p>"But won't the two be seen climbing over that
fence in the daytime?" asked the barrister doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about the daytime, Mr.
Denzil? I did not, and Wrent knows too much to
risk himself at a time that he can be seen from the
windows of the adjacent houses. No! no! The
meeting with Mrs. Clear is to take place in the
front room at ten o'clock, when it will be quite dark.
You, I, and the policemen will hide in what was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>the bedroom, and listen to what Wrent has to say
to Mrs. Clear. We'll give him rope enough to
hang himself, sir, and then pounce out and nab
him."</p>

<p>"Well, he won't show much fight if he is Mr.
Vrain."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he is Mr. Vrain," retorted the
detective bluntly.</p>

<p>"I am doubtful of that, also," admitted Lucian,
"but you know Vrain is now out of the asylum, and,
for the time being, has been left to his own devices.
The reply to the cypher did not appear until he
was in that position. Supposing, after all, this mysterious
Wrent proves to be this unhappy man?"</p>

<p>"In that case, he'll have to pay for his whistle,
sir."</p>

<p>"You mean in connection with the conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and perhaps with the murder of Clear; but
we don't know if the so-called Wrent committed
the crime. For such reason, Mr. Denzil, I wish to
overhear what he says to Mrs. Clear. It is as well
to give him enough rope to hang himself with."</p>

<p>"Can you trust Mrs. Clear?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. She knows on which side her bread
is buttered. Her only chance of getting free from
her share of the matter is to turn Queen's evidence,
and she intends to do so."</p>

<p>"What did she say about Vrain being Wrent?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Link, putting his head on one
side, and looking at Lucian with an odd expression,
"you had better wait till the man's caught be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>fore
I answer that question. Then, maybe, you
won't require an answer."</p>

<p>"It is very probable I won't," replied Lucian
drily. "What time am I to see you to-night?"</p>

<p>"I'll call for you at nine o'clock sharp, and we'll
go across to the house at once. I have the key in
my pocket now. Peacock gave it to me this morning.
The scene will be quite dramatic."</p>

<p>"I hope it won't prove to be Vrain," said Lucian
restlessly, for he thought how grieved Diana would
be.</p>

<p>"I hope not," answered Link curtly, "but there's
no knowing. However, if the old man does get
into trouble he can plead insanity. His having been
in the asylum of Jorce is a strong card for him to
play. Good-day, Mr. Denzil. I'll see you to-night
at nine o'clock sharp."</p>

<p>"Good-day," replied Lucian, and the pair parted
for the time being.</p>

<p>Lucian did not go near Diana that day. In the
first place, he did not wish to see Lydia, for whom
he had no great love; and in the second, he was
afraid to speak to Diana as to the possibility of
her father being Wrent.</p>

<p>Diana, as a good daughter should, held firmly
to the idea that her father could not behave in such
a way; and as a sensible woman, she did not think
that a man with so few of his senses about him
could have acted the dual part with which he was
credited without, in some measure, betraying himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucian was somewhat of this opinion himself, yet
he had an uneasy feeling that Vrain might prove
to be the culprit. The fact of Vrain's being often
away from Mrs. Clear's house in Bayswater, and
Wrent absent in the same way from Mrs. Bensusan's
house in Jersey Street, appeared strange, and
argued a connection between the two. Again, the
resemblance between them was most extraordinary
and unaccountable.</p>

<p>On the whole, Lucian was not satisfied in his
mind as to what would be the end of the matter,
and had he known Mrs. Clear's address he would
have gone to question her about it. But only Link
knew where the woman was to be found, and kept
that information to himself&mdash;especially from Denzil.
Now that he had the reins once more in his
hands, he did not intend that the barrister should
take them again.</p>

<p>Punctual to the minute, Link, in a state of subdued
excitement, came to Lucian's rooms. Already
he had sent his two policemen over to the house,
into which he had instructed them to enter in the
quietest and most unostentatious manner, and now
came to escort the barrister across.</p>

<p>Lucian put on his hat at once, and the two walked
out into the dark night, for dark it was, with no
moon, few stars, and a great many clouds. A most
satisfactory night for their purpose.</p>

<p>"All the better," said Link, casting a look round
the deserted square; "all the better for our little
game. I wish to secure this fellow as quietly as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>possible. Here's the door open&mdash;in with you, Mr.
Denzil!"</p>

<p>According to instructions, a policeman had waited
behind the closed door, and at the one sharp
knock of his superior opened it at once so that the
two slipped in as speedily as possible. Link had
a dark-lantern, which he used carefully, so that no
light could be seen from the window looking on
to the square; and with his three companions he
went into the back room which had formerly been
used by Clear as a sleeping apartment. Here the
two policemen stationed themselves in one corner;
and Link, with Lucian, waited near the door leading
into the sitting-room, so as to be ready for Mrs.
Clear.</p>

<p>All was so dark and lonely and silent that Lucian's
nerves became over-strained, and it was as
much as he could do to prevent himself from trembling
violently. In a whisper he conversed with Link.</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything of that girl Rhoda?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We have traced her to Berkshire," whispered
Link. "She went back to her gypsy kinsfolk, you
know. I dare say we'll manage to lay hands on
her sooner or later."</p>

<p>"She is an accomplice of Wrent's, I believe."</p>

<p>"So do I, and I hope to make him confess as
much to-night. Hush!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Link had laid his clasp on Lucian's
wrist to command silence, and the next moment they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>heard the swish-swish of a woman's dress coming
along the passage. She entered the sitting-room
cautiously, moving slowly in the darkness, and stole
up to the door behind which Lucian and the detective
were hiding. The position of this she knew
well, because it was opposite the window.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" whispered Mrs. Clear nervously.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Link in the same tone. "Myself,
Mr. Denzil, and two policemen. Keep the man
in talk, and find out, if possible, if he committed
the murder."</p>

<p>"I hope he won't kill me," muttered Mrs. Clear.
"He will, if he knows I've betrayed him."</p>

<p>"That will be all right," said Link in a low,
impatient voice. "We will rush out should he prove
dangerous. Get over by the window, so that we
can see a little of you and Wrent when you talk."</p>

<p>"No! no! Don't leave the door open! He'll see
you!"</p>

<p>"He won't, Mrs. Clear. We'll keep back in the
darkness. If he shows a light, we'll rush him before
he can use a weapon or clear out. Get back
to the window!"</p>

<p>"I hope I'll get through with this all right," said
Mrs. Clear nervously. "It's an awful situation,"
and she moved stealthily across the floor to the window.</p>

<p>There was a faint gaslight outside, and the
watchers could see her figure and profile black
against the slight illumination. All was still and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>silent as the grave when they began their dreary
watch.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly in the darkness, and
there was an unbroken silence save for the breathing
of the watchers and the restless movements of
Mrs. Clear near the window. They saw her pass
and repass the square of glass, when, unexpectedly,
she paused, rigid and silent.</p>

<p>A stealthy step was ascending the distant stair,
and pacing cat-like along the passage.</p>

<p>Lucian felt a tremor pass through his body as
the steps of the murderer sounded nearer and clearer.
They paused at the door, and then moved towards
the window where Mrs. Clear was standing.</p>

<p>"Is that you?" said a low voice, which came
weirdly out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have been waiting for the last half hour,
Mr. Wrent," replied the woman in nervous tones.
"I am glad you have come."</p>

<p>"I am glad, also," said the voice harshly, "as I
wish to know why you propose to betray me."</p>

<p>"Because you won't pay me the money," said
Mrs. Clear boldly. "And if you don't give it to
me this very night I'll go straight and tell the police
all about my husband."</p>

<p>"I'll kill you first!" cried the man with a snarl,
and made a dash at the woman. With a cry for
help she eluded him and sprang towards the bedroom
door for protection. The next moment the
four watchers were in the room wrestling with
Wrent. When he felt the grip of their hands, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>knew that he was betrayed, he cried out savagely,
and fought with the strength of two men. However,
he could do little against his four adversaries,
and, worn out with the struggle, collapsed suddenly
on to the dusty floor with a motion of despair.</p>

<p>"Lost! lost!" he muttered. "All lost!"</p>

<p>Breathing hard, Link slipped back the cover of
the dark lantern and turned the light on to the face
of the prisoner. Out of the darkness started a pale
face with white hair and long white beard. Lucian
uttered a cry.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vrain!" he said, shrinking back, "Mr.
Vrain!"</p>

<p>"Look again," said Link, passing his hand rapidly
over the face and head of the prostrate man.
Denzil did look, and uttered a second cry more
startling than the first. Wig and beard and venerable
looks were all gone, and he recognised at
once who Wrent was.</p>

<p>"Jabez Clyne!&mdash;Jabez Clyne!" he exclaimed in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Link triumphantly, "Jabez Clyne,
conspirator and assassin!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE CONFESSION</h3>


<p>"I, Jabez Clyne, write this confession in my
prison cell, of my own free will, and without coercion
from any one; partly because I know that the
evidence concerning my share in the Vrain conspiracy
is strong against me, and partly because I
wish to exonerate my daughter Lydia.</p>

<p>"She is absolutely innocent of all knowledge concerning
the feigned death of her husband and his
actual existence in a private lunatic asylum; and
on the strength of this confession of mine&mdash;which
will fix the guilt of the matter on the right persons&mdash;I
demand that she shall be set free. It is not
fair that she should suffer, for I and Ferruci
planned and carried out the whole conspiracy. Well,
Ferruci has punished himself, and soon the law will
punish me, so it is only justice that Lydia should
be discharged from all blame. On this understanding
I set out the whole story of the affair&mdash;how it
was thought of, how it was contrived, and how it
was carried out. Now that Count Ferruci is dead,
this confession can harm no one but myself, and
may be the means of setting Lydia free. So here I
begin my recital.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p><p>"I was always an unlucky man, and the end of
my life proves to be as unfortunate as the beginning.
I was born in London some fifty and more
years ago, in a Whitechapel slum, of drunken and
profligate parents, so it is little to be wondered at
that my career has been anything but virtuous or
respectable. In my early childhood&mdash;if it may be
called so&mdash;I was beaten and starved, set to beg,
forced to thieve, and never had a kind word said
to me or a kind deed done to me. No wonder I
grew up a callous, hardened ruffian. As the twig is
bent, so will the tree grow.</p>

<p>"Out of this depth of degradation I was rescued
by a philanthropist, who had me fed and clothed
and educated. I had at his hands every chance of
leading a respectable life, but I did not want to
become smug and honest. My early training was
too strong for that, so after a year or two of enforced
goodness I ran away to sea. The vessel I
embarked on as a stowaway was bound for America.
When I was discovered hiding among the cargo
we were in mid-ocean, and there was nothing for
it but to carry me to the States. Still, to earn my
passage, I was made cabin-boy to a ruffianly captain,
and once more tasted the early delights of
childhood, viz., kicks, curses, and starvation. When
the ship arrived in New York I was turned adrift in
the city without a penny or a friend.</p>

<p>"It is not my purpose to describe my sufferings,
as such description will do no good and interest nobody;
particularly as the purpose of this confession
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>is to declare the Vrain conspiracy and its failure;
so I will pass over my early years as speedily as possible.
To be brief: I became a newsboy, then a
reporter; afterwards I went West and tried my
luck in San Francisco, later on in Texas; but in
every case I failed, and became poorer and more
desperate than ever. In New Orleans I set up a
newspaper and had a brief time of prosperity, when
I married the daughter of a hotelkeeper, and for
the time was happy.</p>

<p>"Then the Civil War broke out, and I was ruined.
My wife died, leaving me with one child,
whom I called Lydia, after her, but that child died
also, and I was left alone. After the war I prospered
again for a time, and married a woman with
money. She also died, and left a daughter, and
this child I again called Lydia, in memory of my
first wife, who was the only woman I ever truly
loved. I placed little Lydia in a convent for education,
and devoted my second wife's money to that
purpose; then I started out for the fifth or sixth
time to make my fortune. Needless to say, I did
not make it.</p>

<p>"I pass over a long period of distress and prosperity,
hopes and fears. One day I was rich, the
next poor; and Fate&mdash;or whatever malignant deity
looked after my poor affairs&mdash;knocked me about
most cruelly, tossed me up, threw me down, and at
the end of a score of years left me comparatively
prosperous, with an income, in English money, of
&pound;500 a year. With this I returned to Washington
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>to seek Lydia, and found her grown up into a beautiful
and clever girl. Her beauty gave me the idea
that I might marry her well in Europe as an American
heiress. So for Europe we started, and after
many years of travel about the Continent we settled
down in the Pension Donizetti in Florence.
There Lydia was admired for her beauty and wit,
and courted for her money! But save for my ten
pounds a week, which we eked out in the most
frugal manner, we had not a penny between us.</p>

<p>"It was in Florence that we met with Vrain and
his daughter, who came to stay at the Pension. He
was a quiet, harmless old gentleman, a trifle weak
in the head, which his daughter said came from
over-study, but which I discovered afterwards was
due to habitual indulgence in morphia and other
drugs. His daughter watched him closely, and&mdash;not
having a will of his own by reason of his weak
brain&mdash;he submitted passively to her guidance. I
heard by a side wind that Vrain was rich, and had
a splendid mansion in the country; so I hinted to
Lydia that as it seemed difficult to get her a young
husband, it would be better for her to marry a rich
old one. At that time Lydia was in love with, and
almost engaged to, Count Ercole Ferruci, a penniless
Italian nobleman, who courted my pretty girl
less for her beauty than for her supposed wealth.
When I suggested that Lydia should marry Vrain,
she refused at first to entertain the idea; but afterwards,
seeing that the man was old and weak, she
thought it would be a good thing as his wife to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>inherit his money, and then, as his widow, to marry
Ferruci. I think, also, that the pointed dislike
which Diana Vrain manifested for us both&mdash;although
I am bound to say she hated Lydia more
than she did me&mdash;had a great deal to do with my
daughter marrying Vrain. However, the end of
it was that Lydia broke off her engagement with
Ferruci&mdash;and very mad he was at losing her&mdash;and
married Mark Vrain in Florence.</p>

<p>"After the marriage the old man, who at that
time was quite infatuated with Lydia, made a will
leaving her his assurance money of &pound;20,000, but
the house near Bath, and the land, he left to Diana.
I am bound to say that Lydia behaved very well
in this matter, as she could have had all the money
and land, but she was content with the assurance
money, and did not rob Diana Vrain of her birthright.
Yet Diana hated her, and still hates her;
but I ask any one who reads this confession if my
dear Lyddy is not the better woman of the two?
Who dares to say that such a sweet girl is guilty
of the crimes she is charged with?</p>

<p>"Well, the marriage took place, and we all journeyed
home to Berwin Manor; but here things went
from bad to worse. Old Vrain took again to his
morphia, and nothing would restrain him; then
Lydia and Diana fought constantly, and each
wished the other out of the house. I tried to keep
the peace, and blamed Lyddy&mdash;who is no saint, I
admit&mdash;for the way in which she was treating
Diana. With Miss Vrain I got on very well, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>tried to make things easy for her; but in the end
the ill-will between her and my Lydia became so
strong that Diana left the house, and went out to
Australia to live with some relatives.</p>

<p>"So Lydia and I and old Vrain were left alone,
and I thought that everything would be right. So
it would have been if Lydia had not put matters
wrong again by inviting Ferruci over to stay. But
she would insist upon doing so, and although I
begged and prayed and commanded her not to have
so dangerous a man in the house, she held her own;
and in the face of my remonstrances, and those of
her husband, Count Ferruci came to stay with us.</p>

<p>"From the moment he entered the house there
was nothing but trouble. Vrain became jealous,
and, mad with drugs he took, often treated Lydia
with cruelty and violence, and she came to me for
protection. I spoke to Vrain, and he insulted me,
wishing to turn me out of the house; but for Lydia's
sake I remained. Then a Miss Tyler came to stay,
and falling in love with Count Ferruci, grew jealous
of Lydia, and made trouble with Vrain. The
end of it was that after a succession of scenes, in
which the old man behaved like the lunatic he was,
he left the house, and not one of us knew where he
went to. That was the last Lydia saw of her husband.</p>

<p>"After that trouble I insisted that Count Ferruci
should leave the house; also Miss Tyler. They
both did, but came back at times to pay Lydia a
visit. We tried to find Vrain, but could not, as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>had vanished altogether. Ferruci, I saw, was in
love with Lydia, and she with him, but neither the
one nor the other hinted at a future marriage should
Vrain die. I do not say that Lydia was a fond wife
to Vrain, but he treated her so badly that he could
not expect her to be; and I dare say I am the one to
blame all through, as I made Lydia marry Vrain
when she loved Ferruci. But I did it all for the
best, so as to get money for my dear girl; and if it
has turned out for the worst, my inordinate affection
for my child is to blame. All I have done has been
for Lydia's sake; all Ferruci did was for Lydia's
sake, as he truly loved her; but I swear by all that
I hold most holy that Lydia knew not how either
of us was working to secure her happiness. Well,
Ferruci is dead, and I am in jail, so we have paid
in full for our wickedness.</p>

<p>"I had no idea of getting rid of Vrain until one
day Ferruci took me aside and told me that he had
found Vrain at Salisbury. He stated that the man
was still taking morphia, but in spite of his excesses
had so strong a constitution that it appeared he
would live for many years. The Count then said
that he loved Lydia dearer than life, and wished
to marry her if Vrain could be got out of the way.
I cried out against murder being done, as I never
entertained such an idea for a moment; but Ferruci
denied that he wished to harm the man. He
wanted him put away in a lunatic asylum, and when
I asked him how even then he could marry Lydia,
he suggested his scheme of substituting a sickly and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>dying man for Vrain. The scheme&mdash;which was
entirely invented by the Count&mdash;was as follows:</p>

<p>"Ferruci said that in a minor London theatre he
had seen an actor called Clear, who was wonderfully
like Vrain, save that he had no scar on the
cheek, and had a moustache, whereas Vrain was
always clean-shaved. He had made the acquaintance
of the actor&mdash;Michael Clear was his full
name&mdash;and of his wife. They proved to be hard
up and mercenary, so Ferruci had no difficulty in
gaining over both for his purpose. For a certain
sum of money (which was to be paid to Mrs. Clear
when her husband was dead and the Count, married
to Lydia, was possessed of the assurance money)
Clear agreed to shave off his moustache and personate
Vrain. Ferruci, who was something of a
chemist, created by means of some acid a scar on
Clear's cheek like that on Vrain's, so that he resembled
my son-in-law in every way save that he
had lost one little finger.</p>

<p>"Ferruci wanted me to join him in the conspiracy
so that I could watch Clear impersonating Vrain,
while he himself kept his eye on the real Vrain, who
was to be received into Mrs. Clear's house at Bayswater
and passed off as her husband. All Mrs.
Clear wanted was the money, as&mdash;long since wearied
of her drunken husband&mdash;she did not care if he
lived or died. Clear, on his part, knowing that he
could not live long, was quite willing to play the
part of Vrain on condition that he had plenty to
eat and drink, and could live in idleness and lux<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>ury.
His wishes in this direction cost us a pretty
penny, as he bought everything of the best.</p>

<p>"To this plot I refused consent until I saw how
Vrain was: so when Ferruci brought him from Salisbury&mdash;where
he was hiding&mdash;to London, I had an
interview with him. He proved to be so stupefied
with drugs that he hardly knew me, so, seeing that
my Lydia would get no good out of her life by being
tied to such a husband, I determined that I would
assist Ferruci, on the understanding, of course, that
Vrain was to be well looked after in every way.
We agreed that when Clear died, and his body was
identified as Vrain's, that the real man should be
put in an asylum, which was&mdash;and I am sure every
one will agree with me&mdash;the best place for him.</p>

<p>"All this being arranged, I went out to look for
a house in a secluded part of the town, in which
Clear&mdash;under the name of Berwin&mdash;should live until
he died as Vrain. I did not wish to see about
the house in my new character, lest I should be
recognised, if there was any trouble over the assurance
money; to complicate matters, I determined
to disguise myself as the real Vrain. Of course,
Clear personated Vrain as Lydia had last seen him,
that is, clean-shaven, and neat in his dress. But
the real Vrain, neglecting his personal appearance,
had cultivated a long, white beard, and wore a black
velvet skull-cap to conceal a baldness which had
come upon him. I disguised myself in this fashion,
therefore, and went to Pimlico under the name of
Wrent."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>THE CONFESSION (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>


<p>"In Geneva Square, Pimlico, I found the house
I wanted. It was No. 13, and was said to be haunted,
as cries had been heard in it at night, and lights
had been seen flitting from window to window when
no one was in the house. I looked at it without entering,
or calling on the landlord, and then I went
into Jersey Street to see the back. The house in
the same section with it was kept by a Mrs. Bensusan,
who took in lodgers. Her rooms were vacant,
and as it suited me very well that I should be a
neighbour to Clear, I took the rooms. They proved&mdash;as
I shall explain&mdash;better for our purpose than
I was aware of.</p>

<p>"When I told Ferruci of my discovery, he gave
Clear money and made him hire the house and furnish
two rooms for himself. I supplied the money.
In this way Clear, calling himself Berwin, which
was the name of Vrain's house in the country, came
to live in Pimlico. We also removed the real Vrain
to Mrs. Clear's at Bayswater, and he passed as her
husband. So weak were his brains, and so cowed
was his spirit, that there was no difficulty in keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>ing
him in the house, and the neighbours were told
merely that Clear was ill.</p>

<p>"For my part, I took up my abode in Jersey
Street under the name of Wrent, and met Clear
outside on occasions when it was necessary for me
to see him; but I never entered the house&mdash;for obvious
reasons.</p>

<p>"I was constantly afraid lest Clear, in his drunken
fits&mdash;for he was always more or less drunk&mdash;should
reveal our secret, and I took as my bedroom
an apartment in Mrs. Bensusan's out of the window
of which I could overlook the back of No. 13. One
night, when I was watching, I saw a dark figure
glide into Mrs. Bensusan's yard and climb over
the fence, only to disappear. I was terribly alarmed,
and wondering what was wrong, I put on my
clothes and hurried downstairs into the yard. Also
I climbed over the fence into the yard of No. 13.
Here I could not see where the figure had disappeared
to, as the doors and windows at the back
of the house were all locked. I could not conjecture
who the woman was&mdash;for it was a woman I
saw&mdash;who had entered, or why she had done so, or
in what way she had gained admission.</p>

<p>"While I was thus thinking I saw the woman
again. She apparently rose out of the earth, and
after closing what appeared to be a trap-door, she
made for the fence. I stopped her before she got
there, and found to my surprise that she was a red-headed
servant of Mrs. Bensusan's&mdash;a kind of
gypsy, very clever, and&mdash;I think&mdash;with much evil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>in her. She was alarmed at being discovered, and
begged me not to tell on her. For my own sake,
I promised not to do so, but made her explain how
she got into the house, and why she entered it. Then
she told me an extraordinary tale.</p>

<p>"For some years, she said, she had been with
Mrs. Bensusan, who had taken her from the gypsies
to civilise her, and hating the restraint of civilised
life, she had been in the habit of roaming about
at night. Knowing that the house at the back was
unoccupied, this Rhoda&mdash;for that is her name&mdash;climbed
over the fence and tried to get into it, but
found the doors and windows bolted and barred.</p>

<p>"Then one night she saw a kind of grated window
amid the grass, and as this proved not to be
bolted, she pulled it open. Taking a candle with
her, she went on a voyage of discovery, and dropped
through this hole some distance into a disused cellar.
Only a cat could have got in safely, for the
height was considerable; and, indeed, Rhoda did
not risk that mode of entrance again, for, finding
a ladder in the cellar, which, I presume, had been
used to get at the higher bins of wine, she placed
this against the aperture, and thus was enabled
to ascend and descend without difficulty. Frequently
by this means she entered the empty house, and
went from room to room with her candle, singing
gypsy songs as she wandered. So here I had found
the ghost of No. 13, although I don't suppose this
impish gypsy girl knew as much. She haunted the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>house just to amuse herself, when fat Mrs. Bensusan
thought she was safe in bed.</p>

<p>"I asked Rhoda why she had entered the house
on that particular night when I had caught her.
She confessed that she had seen some articles of silver
in Clear's rooms which she wished to steal; but
on this occasion he had locked the door&mdash;a thing
which he did not always do in his drunken humours&mdash;and
so Rhoda was returning disappointed. After
this confession I made her go back to her own house
and promised to keep her secret. I also told her
that if she held her tongue I would give her a
present. For this purpose I made Ferruci buy me
a cloak lined with rabbit skins, as Rhoda on her
night excursions wanted something to keep her
warm. When Ferruci gave it to me, and it was
lying in my room, Mrs. Clear came one night to see
me, and finding it cold, she borrowed the cloak to
wrap round her. She kept it for some time, and
brought it back on Christmas Eve, when I gave it
next day to Rhoda. It was Ferruci who bought
the cloak, not I; and it was purchased for Rhoda,
not for Mrs. Clear.</p>

<p>"The next night I entered No. 13 by the cellarway,
and found it of great advantage, as I could
visit Clear without exciting suspicion, and so keep
an eye on him. At first he was alarmed by my unexpected
appearance, but when I showed him the
secret way, he made use of it also. We used it only
on dark nights, and it was for this reason that we
were not noticed by the neighbours. It would never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>have done for any one of us to be seen climbing over
the fence. Mrs. Clear once visited her husband,
and had a quarrel with him about his drinking. It
was her shadow and Clear's which Denzil saw on
the blind. As soon as they heard his ring they both
went out the back way, and in climbing hurriedly
over the fence Mrs. Clear tore her veil. It was a
portion of this which Denzil found.</p>

<p>"On that night, Clear, after leaving his wife,
entered the square by the front, and so met with
Denzil, much to the latter's surprise. I was very
angry when Clear showed Denzil over the house;
but he said that the young man was very suspicious,
and he only showed him the house to prove that
there was no one in it, and that he must have been
mistaken about the shadows on the blind. Notwithstanding
this explanation, I did not approve of
Clear's act, nor, indeed, of his acquaintance with
Denzil.</p>

<p>"For some months matters went on in this way.
Clear remained in the Silent House, drinking himself
to death; Mrs. Clear looked after Vrain in her
Bayswater house; and I, in my old-man disguise,
remained in Jersey Street, although at times I left
there and went to see my daughter. All this time
Lydia had no idea of what we were preparing.
Then I began to grow wearied of the position, for
Clear proved tougher than we anticipated, and
showed no signs of dying. In despair, I thought I
would give him the means to kill himself.</p>

<p>"Mind, I did not wish to murder him myself;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>but the man, when in his drinking fits, thought he
was attacked by enemies, and when in a melancholic
frame of mind, on recovery, would frequently hint
at suicide. I therefore thought that if a weapon
were left within his reach he might kill himself.
I don't defend my conduct in this case, but surely
this drunken scoundrel was better dead than alive.
In choosing a weapon, I wished to select one that
would implicate Ferruci rather than myself, in case
there was any trouble over the matter; so I chose
for my purpose a stiletto which hung by a parti-coloured
ribbon on the walls of the library at Berwin
Manor. I fancied that the stiletto, having
been bought in Florence, and Ferruci coming from
Florence, he, if anyone&mdash;should any of these facts
come to light&mdash;would be credited with giving it
to Clear.</p>

<p>"I took this stiletto from Berwin Manor some
time before Christmas, and, bringing it up to town,
I left it, on the day before Christmas, on the table
in Clear's sitting-room. That was at nine o'clock
in the night, and that was when I last saw him
alive. Who killed him I know no more than any
one else.</p>

<p>"On Christmas Eve I was ill, and wrote to Lydia
to come up. She met me at the Pegalls', but as I
felt ill, I left there at six o'clock, and Lydia stayed
with the family all night. At seven o'clock Mrs.
Clear came to me with Ferruci, and brought back
the cloak which I gave afterwards to Rhoda. She
wanted to see her husband again, but I refused to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>let her risk the visit. Ferruci came to tell me that
he was arranging to place Vrain&mdash;who was becoming
too violent to be restrained&mdash;in the private
asylum of Dr. Jorce, at Hampstead. Mrs. Clear
was to go with him, and we conversed about the
matter.</p>

<p>"Ferruci went away first, as he desired to see
Clear, and for that purpose waited about until it
was darker, and went into the back yard shortly
after eight o'clock. There he was seen by Rhoda
as he was about to climb the fence, and, not knowing
it was the girl, he took fright and ran out of the
yard into Jersey Street. Here he found Mrs. Clear,
who had left me and was waiting for him, and
the pair went off to see Dr. Jorce at Hampstead.
I believe they remained there all night.</p>

<p>"Left alone, I climbed over the fence about nine
o'clock, and saw Clear. He was celebrating Christmas
Eve by drinking heavily, and I was unable to
bring him to reason. I therefore left the stiletto
which I had brought with me on the table, and
returned to my house in Jersey Street. I never saw
him alive again. I went to bed and slept all night,
so I was aware of nothing in connection with the
death until late on Christmas Day. Then Mrs.
Bensusan was told by Miss Greeb, the landlady of
Denzil, that the tenant of No. 13 had been murdered.
I fancied that he had killed himself in a
fit of melancholia, with the stiletto I had left on
his table; but I did not dare to go near the house
to find this out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p><p>"Afterwards I learned that the doctor who examined
the body was of the opinion that Clear had
been murdered; and, being afraid about the police
taking up the case, I paid Mrs. Bensusan a week's
rent and left her house two days after Christmas.
I returned to Berwin Manor, and shortly afterwards
Ferruci joined me there, as he had successfully
incarcerated Vrain in the asylum under the
name of Michael Clear.</p>

<p>"When the advertisement came out, it was I
who hinted to Lydia that the dead man&mdash;seeing
that he was called Berwin&mdash;might be her husband.
We went up to town: Lydia identified the body of
Clear as her husband in all innocence&mdash;for after
death the man looked more like Vrain than ever;
and in due time the assurance money was obtained.</p>

<p>"I do not think there is anything more to tell,
save that I did not know that Mrs. Clear had betrayed
me. I could not pay her the money, as I
could not get it from Lydia. I told Lydia I was
going to Paris, but in reality I was hunting for
Rhoda, who had run away from Jersey Street. I
fancied she might betray us, and wished to make
things safe with her. Before I found her, however,
I saw in the papers that Ferruci had committed
suicide; also that Lydia&mdash;who had gone to
Dover to meet me, thinking I was returning from
Paris&mdash;had been arrested. Then I saw Mrs. Clear's
advertisement saying she would betray me if I did
not pay the money. I consented to meet her in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>order to implore her silence, and so fell into the
clutches of the law.</p>

<p>"I may state that I did not kill Clear, as I never
saw him after nine o'clock, and then he was alive.
In spite of what the doctor said, I am still inclined
to think he killed himself. Now I have made a
clean breast of it&mdash;I am willing to be punished; but
I hope Lydia will be set free, for whosoever is
guilty, she is innocent. I have been an unlucky
man, and I remain one at this moment when I sign
myself for the last time, <span class="smcap">Jabez Clyne</span>."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Needless to say, both Link and Denzil were
greatly surprised at this confession, which revealed
all things save the one they wished to know.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this idea of suicide?"
asked Lucian.</p>

<p>"It is quite out of the question," replied the detective
decidedly. "The doctor who examined the
body said that it was impossible the man could have
committed suicide. The position of the wound
shows that; also the power of the stroke. No man
could drive a stiletto so dexterously and strongly
into the heart. Also the room was in confusion,
which points to a struggle, and the stiletto is missing.
It was not suicide, but murder, and I believe
either Clyne or Ferruci killed the man."</p>

<p>"But Ferruci was not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was not there after ten," interrupted Link,
"but he was there about eight. I dare say when
Rhoda saw him he was coming back after having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>committed the deed, and Clyne says the stiletto was
not there at the time just to screen him."</p>

<p>"It is of little use to screen the dead," said Lucian.
"I think only one person can tell the truth
about this murder, and that is Rhoda."</p>

<p>"I'm looking for her, Mr. Denzil."</p>

<p>This was easy saying, but harder doing, for
weeks passed away, and in spite of all the efforts of
the police Rhoda could not be found. Then one
morning the detective, much excited, burst into
Lucian's rooms waving a paper over his head.</p>

<p>"A confession!" he cried. "Another confession!"</p>

<p>"Of whom?" asked Lucian, surprised.</p>

<p>"Of Rhoda!" replied Link excitedly. "She has
confessed! It was Rhoda who killed Michael
Clear!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>WHAT RHODA HAD TO SAY</h3>


<p>Of all the news concerning the truth of Clear's
death, this was the last which Lucian expected to
hear. He stood staring at the excited face of the
detective in wide-eyed surprise, and for the moment
could not find his voice.</p>

<p>"It is true, I tell you!" cried Link, sitting down
and smoothing out the paper which he carried.
"Rhoda, and none other, killed the man!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Link?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. This," flourishing the paper,
"is her dying confession."</p>

<p>"Her dying confession?" repeated the barrister
blankly. "Is she dead, also?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is a long story, Mr. Denzil. Sit down,
and I'll tell it to you. As you have had so much
to do with the beginning of the case, it is only fair
that you should know the end, and a strange end
it is."</p>

<p>Without a word Lucian sat down, feeling quite
confused, for in no way could he guess how Clear
had come by his death at the hands of Rhoda. He
had suspected Lydia as guilty of the crime; he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>credited Ferruci with its commission, and he had
been certain of the guilt of Clyne, <i>alias</i> Wrent; but
to discover that the red-headed servant was the culprit
entirely bewildered him. She had no motive
to kill the man; she had given evidence freely in
the matter, and in all respects had acted as an innocent
person. So this was why she had left Jersey
Street? It was a fear of being arrested for the
crime which had driven her into the wilds. But, as
Lucian privately thought, she need not have fled,
for&mdash;so far as he could see&mdash;beyond the startling
announcement of Link, there was no evidence to
connect her with the matter. It was most extraordinary.</p>

<p>"I see you are astonished," said Link, with a
nod; "so was I. Of all folk, I least suspected that
imp of a girl. The truth would never have been
known, had she not confessed at the last moment;
for even now I cannot see, on the face of it, any
evidence&mdash;save her own confession&mdash;to inculpate
her in the matter. So you see, Mr. Denzil, the
mystery of this man's death, which we have been
so anxious to solve, has not been explained by you,
or discovered by me, but has been brought to light
by chance, which, after all, is the great detective.
You may well look astonished," repeated the man
slowly; "I am&mdash;immensely."</p>

<p>"Let me hear the confession, Link!"</p>

<p>"Wait one moment. I'll tell you how it came
to be made, and then I'll relate the story in my own
fashion, as the way in which the confession is writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>ten
is too muddled for you to understand clearly.
Still, it shows plainly enough that Clyne, for all our
suspicions, is innocent."</p>

<p>"And Rhoda, the sharp servant girl, guilty," said
Lucian, reflectively. "I never should have thought
that she was involved in the matter. How the
deuce did she come to confess?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Link, clearing his throat as a preliminary
to his narrative, "it seems that Mr. Bensusan,
in a fit of philanthropy, picked up this
wretched girl in the country. She belonged to some
gypsies, but as her parents were dead, and the child
a burden, the tribe were glad to get rid of her.
Rhoda Stanley&mdash;that is her full name&mdash;was taken
to London by Mrs. Bensusan, who tried to civilise
her."</p>

<p>"I don't think she succeeded very well, Link.
Rhoda, with her cunning ways and roaming about
at night, was always a savage at heart. In spite
of what Clyne says in his confession, I believe she
took a delight in turning No. 13 into a haunted
house with her shrieking and her flitting candles.
How she must have enjoyed herself when she heard
the talk about the ghost!"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt she did, Mr. Denzil, but even
those delights wearied her, and she longed to get
back to the free gypsy life. When she found&mdash;through
you, sir&mdash;that the police wanted to know
too much about Clear's death, she left Mrs. Bensusan
in the lurch, and tramped off down to the New
Forest, where she picked up again with her tribe."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p><p>"How did her mistress take her desertion?"</p>

<p>"Very much to heart, as she had treated the
young savage very kindly, and ought to have received
more gratitude. Perhaps when she hears
how her adopted child wandered about at night, and
ended by killing Clear, she will be glad she is dead
and buried. Yet, I don't know. Women are wonderfully
soft-hearted, and certainly Rhoda is
thought no end of by that fat woman."</p>

<p>"Well! well!" said Lucian, impatient of this digression.
"So Rhoda went back to her tribe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and as she was sharp, clever, and,
moreover, came with some money which she had
stolen from Mrs. Bensusan&mdash;for she added theft to
ingratitude&mdash;she was received with open arms.
With her gypsy cousins she went about in the true
gypsy style, but, not being hardened to the outdoor
life in wet weather, she fell ill."</p>

<p>"Civilisation made her delicate, I suppose," said
Denzil grimly.</p>

<p>"Exactly; she was not fit for the tent life after
having lived for so long under a comfortable roof.
She fell ill with inflammation of the lungs, and in
a wonderfully short space of time she died."</p>

<p>"When did she confess her crime?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that, sir. When she was dying
she sent two gypsies to the nearest magistrate&mdash;who
happened to be the vicar of the parish in which
the tribe were then encamped&mdash;and asked him to
see her on a matter of life and death. The vicar
came at once, and when he became aware that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>Rhoda was the girl wanted in the Vrain case&mdash;for
he had read all about her in the papers&mdash;he became
very interested. He took down the confession of
the wretched girl, had it signed by two witnesses
and Rhoda herself, and sent it up to Scotland
Yard."</p>

<p>"And this confession&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Link, pointing to the manuscript
on the table; "but it is too long to read, so
I shall just tell you briefly what Rhoda confessed,
and how she committed the crime."</p>

<p>"Go on! I am most anxious to hear, Link!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Denzil, you know that Rhoda was
in the habit of visiting No. 13 by night and amusing
herself by wandering about the empty rooms,
although I don't know what pleasure she found in
doing so. It seems that when Clear became the
tenant of the house, Rhoda was very angry, as his
presence interfered with her midnight capers. However,
on seeing his rooms&mdash;for Clear found her one
night, and took her in to show them to her&mdash;she
was filled with admiration, and with true gypsy
instinct wanted to steal some of the ornaments. She
tried to pocket a silver paper-knife on that very
night Clear was so hospitable to her, but she was
not sharp enough, and the man saw the theft. In
a rage at her dishonesty he turned her out of the
room, and swore that he would thrash her if she
came into his presence again."</p>

<p>"Did the threat keep Rhoda away?"</p>

<p>"Not it. I am sure you saw enough of that wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>cat
to know nothing would frighten her. She certainly
did not thrust herself personally on Clear,
but whenever his back was turned she took to stealing
things out of his room, when he was foolish
enough to leave the door open. Clear was much
enraged, and complained to Clyne&mdash;known to
Rhoda as Wrent&mdash;who in his turn read the girl a
sharp lecture.</p>

<p>"But having shown Clyne the cellarway into the
house, Miss Rhoda knew too much, and laughed
in Clyne's face. He did not dare to make her thefts
public, or complain to Mrs. Bensusan, lest Rhoda
should tell of the connection between him and the
tenant of the Silent House, who passed under the
name of Berwin. Therefore, he told Clear to keep
his sitting-room door locked."</p>

<p>"A wise precaution, with that imp about," said
Lucian. "I hope Clear was sensible enough to adopt
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. When he was sober he locked the
door, and when drunk he left it open, and Rhoda
looted at will. And now comes the more important
part of the confession. You remember that Clyne
left the stiletto from Berwin Manor on Clear's
table?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with the amiable intention that the poor
devil should kill himself. He left it on Christmas
Eve, too&mdash;a pleasant time for a man to commit
suicide!"</p>

<p>"Of course, the intention was horrible!" said
Mr. Link, gravely. "Some people might think such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>an act incredible; but I have seen so much of the
worst side of human nature that I am not surprised.
Clyne was too cowardly to kill the man
himself, so he thought to make Clear his own executioner
by leaving the stiletto in his way. Well,
sir, the weapon proved to be useful in the way it
was intended by Clyne, for Clear was killed with
that very weapon."</p>

<p>"And by Rhoda!" said Lucian, nodding. "I
see! How did she get hold of it?"</p>

<p>"By accident. When Wrent&mdash;I mean Clyne&mdash;and
Mrs. Bensusan went to bed on Christmas Eve,
Rhoda thought she would have some of her devil
dances in the haunted house; so she slipped out of
bed and into the yard, and dropped down into the
cellar, whence she went up to Clear's rooms."</p>

<p>"Was Clear in bed?"</p>

<p>"No; but he was in his bedroom, and, according
to Rhoda, furiously drunk. You know that Clyne
said the man had been drinking all day. On this
night he had left his sitting-room door open, and
the lamp burning. On the table was the silver-handled
stiletto, with the ribbon; and when Rhoda
peered into the room to see what she could pick up,
she thought she would like this pretty toy. She
stole forward softly and took the stiletto, but before
she could get back to the door, Clear, who
had been watching her, reeled out and rushed at
her."</p>

<p>"Did she run away?"</p>

<p>"She couldn't. Clear was between her and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>door. She ran round the room, upsetting everything,
for she thought he would kill her in his
drunken rage. Don't you remember, Mr. Denzil,
how disorderly the room was? Well, Clear got
Rhoda into a corner, and was going to strike her;
she had the stiletto still in her hand, and held it
point outward to save herself from the blow. She
thought when he saw the weapon he would not
dare to come nearer. However, either he did not
see the stiletto, or was too drunk to feel fear, for
he stumbled and fell forward, so that the dagger
ran right into his heart. In a moment he fell dead,
before he had time, as Rhoda says, to even utter
a cry."</p>

<p>"So it was an accident, after all?" said Lucian.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, quite an accident," replied Link, "and
I can see very plainly how it took place. Of course,
Rhoda was terrified at what she had done&mdash;although
she really was not to blame&mdash;and leaving
the dead man, ran away with the stiletto. She
dropped the ribbon off it near the cellar door as
she was running away, and there Mrs. Kebby found
it."</p>

<p>"What did she do with the stiletto?"</p>

<p>"She had it in her room, and when she left Mrs.
Bensusan she carried it with her down the country.
In proof of the truth, she gave it to the vicar
who wrote down her confession, and he sent it up
with the papers to Scotland Yard. Queer case,
isn't it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p><p>"Very queer, Link. I thought everybody was
guilty but Rhoda."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the detective, significantly, "it is always
the least suspected person who is guilty. I
could have sworn that Clyne was the man. Now
it seems that he is innocent, so instead of hanging
he will only be imprisoned for his share in the conspiracy."</p>

<p>"He may escape that way," said Lucian drily,
"but, morally speaking, I regard him as more guilty
than Rhoda."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>THE END OF IT ALL</h3>


<p>Two years after the discovery of Rhoda's guilt,
Mr. and Mrs. Denzil were seated in the garden of
Berwin Manor. It was a perfect summer evening,
at the sunset hour, something like that evening
when, in the same garden, almost at the same time,
Lucian had asked Diana to be his wife. But between
then and now twenty-four months had
elapsed, and many things had taken place of more
or less importance to the young couple.</p>

<p>The mystery of Clear's death had been solved;
Lydia had been set free as innocent of crime; her
father, found guilty of conspiracy to obtain the
assurance money, had been condemned to a long
term of imprisonment, and, what most concerned
Lucian and Diana, Mark Vrain had really and truly
gone the way of all flesh.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the Vrain case Lucian
had become formally engaged to Diana, but it was
agreed between them that the marriage should not
take place for some time on account of her father's
health. After his discharge as cured from the asylum
of Dr. Jorce, Miss Vrain had taken her father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>down to his own place in the country, and there
tended him with the most affectionate solicitude,
in the hope that he would recover his health. But
the hope was vain, for by his over-indulgence in
morphia, his worrying and wandering, and irregular
mode of life, Vrain had completely shattered his
health. He lapsed into a state of second childhood,
and, being deprived of the drugs which formerly
had excited him to a state of frenzy, sank into a
pitiable condition. For days he would remain without
speaking to any one, and even ceased to take a
pleasure in his books. Finally his limbs became
paralysed, and so he spent the last few months of
his wretched life in a bath-chair, being wheeled
round the garden.</p>

<p>Still, his constitution was so strong that he lived
for quite twelve months after his return to his home,
and died unexpectedly in his sleep. Diana was not
sorry when he passed so easily away, for death was
a merciful release of his tortured soul from his
worn-out body. So Mark Vrain died, and was buried,
and after the funeral Diana went abroad, with
Miss Priscilla Barbar for a companion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Lucian stayed in grimy, smoky
London, and worked hard at his profession. He
was beginning to be known, and in time actually received
a brief or two, with which he did his best
in court. Still, he was far from being the successful
pleader he hoped to be, for law, of all professions,
is one which demands time and industry for
the attainment of any degree of excellence. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>rarely that a young lawyer can go to sleep and wake
to find himself famous; he must crawl rather than
run. With diligence and punctuality, and observance
of every chance, in time the wished-for goal is
reached, although that goal, in nine cases out of ten,
is a very moderate distance off. Lucian did not sigh
for a judgeship, or for a seat on the Woolsack; he
was content to be a barrister with a good practice,
and perhaps a Q.C.-ship in prospect. However,
during the year of Diana's mourning he did so well
that he felt justified in asking her to marry him
when she returned. Diana, on her side, saw no obstacle
to this course, so she consented.</p>

<p>"If you are not rich, my dear, I am," she said,
when Lucian alleged his poverty as the only bar
to their union, "and as money gives me no pleasure
without you, I do not care to stay in Berwin Manor
in lonely spinsterhood. I shall marry you whenever
you choose."</p>

<p>And Lucian, taking advantage of this gracious
permission, did choose to be married, and that
speedily; so within two years after the final closing
of the Vrain case they became man and wife. At
the time they were seated in the garden, at the
hour of sunset, they had only lately returned from
their honeymoon, and were now talking over past
experiences. Miss Priscilla, who had been left in
charge of the Manor during their absence, had welcomed
them back with much joy, as she looked upon
the match as one of her own making. Now she
had gone inside, on the understanding that two are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>company and three are none, and the young couple
were left alone. Hand in hand, after the foolish
fashion of lovers, they sat under a leafy oak tree,
and the sunlight glowed redly on their happy faces.
After a short silence Lucian looked at the face of
his wife and laughed.</p>

<p>"What is amusing you, dear?" said Mrs. Denzil,
with a sympathetic smile.</p>

<p>"My thoughts were rather pleasant than amusing,"
replied Lucian, giving the hand that lay in
his a squeeze, "but I was thinking of Hans Andersen's
tale of the Elder Mother Tree, and of the
old couple who sat enjoying their golden wedding
under the linden, with the red sunlight shining on
their silver crowns."</p>

<p>"We are under an oak and wear no crowns," replied
Diana in her turn, "but we are quite as happy,
I think, although it is not our golden wedding."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that will come some day, Diana."</p>

<p>"Fifty years, my dear; it's a long way off yet,"
said Mrs. Denzil dubiously.</p>

<p>"I am glad it is, for I shall have (D.V.,) fifty
years of happiness with you to look forward to.
Upon my word, Diana, I think you deserve happiness,
after all the trouble you have had."</p>

<p>"With you I am sure to be happy, Lucian, but
other people, poor souls, are not so well off."</p>

<p>"What other people?"</p>

<p>"Jabez Clyne, for one."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Lucian, seriously, "I hope I
am not a hard man, but I really cannot find it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>my heart to pity Clyne. He was&mdash;and I dare say is&mdash;a
scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"I don't deny that he acted badly," sighed Diana,
"but it was for his daughter's sake, you know."</p>

<p>"There is a limit even to paternal affection,
Diana. And putting aside the wickedness of the
whole conspiracy, I cannot pardon a man who deliberately
put a weapon in the way of a man almost
insane with drink, in order that he might kill himself.
The idea was diabolically wicked, my dear,
and I think that Jabez Clyne, <i>alias</i> Wrent, quite
deserves the long imprisonment he received."</p>

<p>"At all events, the Sirius Company got back their
money, Lucian."</p>

<p>"So much as Lydia had not spent they got back,
Diana; but when your father actually died they
had to part with it very soon again, and some of it
has gone into Lydia's pocket after all."</p>

<p>Diana blushed. "It was only right, dear," she
said, apologetically. "When my father made his
new will, leaving it all to me, I did not think that
Lydia, however badly she treated him, should be
left absolutely penniless. And you know, Lucian,
you agreed that I should share the assurance money
with her."</p>

<p>"I did," replied Denzil. "Of two evils I chose
the least, for if Lydia had not got a portion of
the money she would have been quite capable of
trying to upset the second will on the ground that
Mr. Vrain was insane."</p>

<p>"Papa was not insane," reproved Diana. "He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>was weak, I admit, but at the time he made that
will he had all his senses. Besides, after all the
scandal of the case, I don't think Lydia would have
dared to go to law about it. Still, it was best to
give her the money, and I hear from Miss Priscilla
that Lydia is now in Italy, and proposes to marry
an Italian prince."</p>

<p>"She has flown higher than a count, then. Poor
Ferruci killed himself for her sake."</p>

<p>"For his own, rather," exclaimed Mrs. Denzil
energetically. "He knew that if he lived he would
be punished by imprisonment, so chose to kill himself
rather than suffer such dishonour. I believe he
truly loved Lydia, certainly, but as he wanted the
assurance money, I fancy he sinned quite as much
for his own sake as for Lydia's."</p>

<p>"No doubt; and I dare say Lydia loved him,
after her own fashion; yet she seems to have forgotten
him pretty soon, and&mdash;as you say&mdash;intends
to marry a prince. I don't envy his highness."</p>

<p>"She has no heart, so I dare say she will be happy
as such women ever are," said Diana contemptuously,
"yet her happiness comes out of much evil.
If she had not married my father, her own would
not now be in prison, nor would Count Ferruci and
Rhoda be dead."</p>

<p>"Ferruci, perhaps, might still be alive, and her
husband," assented Lucian, "but I have my doubts
about Rhoda. She was a wicked, precocious little
imp, that girl, and sooner or later would have come
to a bad end. The death of Clear was due to an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>accident, I admit; but Rhoda has still one person
who laments over her, for, although Mrs. Bensusan
knows the truth, she always thinks of that red-haired
minx as a kind of martyr, who was led into
wicked ways by Clyne, <i>alias</i> Wrent."</p>

<p>"I am sure Mrs. Clear doesn't think so."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clear has got quite enough to think about
in remembering how narrowly she escaped imprisonment
for her share in that shameful conspiracy.
If she had not turned Queen's evidence, she would
have been punished as Clyne was; as it is, she just
escaped by an accident. Still, if it had not been
for her, we should never have discovered the truth.
I would never have suspected Clyne, who was always
so meek and mild. Even that visit he paid
to me to lament over his daughter's probable marriage
to Ferruci was a trick to find out how much
I knew."</p>

<p>"Don't you think he hated Ferruci?"</p>

<p>"No; I am sure he did not. He acted a part
to find out what I was doing. If Mrs. Clear had
not betrayed him we should never have discovered
the conspiracy."</p>

<p>"And if Rhoda had not spoken, the mystery of
Clear's death would never have been solved," said
Diana, "although she only confessed at the eleventh
hour, and when she was dying."</p>

<p>"I think Link was pleased that the mystery was
solved in so unexpected a way," said Lucian, laughing.
"He never forgave my finding out so much
without his aid. He ascribes the ending of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>whole matter to chance, and I dare say he is right."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Mrs. Denzil, who had no great
love for the detective. "He certainly left everything
to chance. Twice he gave up the case.".</p>

<p>"And twice I gave it up," said Denzil. "If it
had not been for you, dear, I should never have
gone on with what seemed to be a hopeless task.
But when I first met you you induced me to continue
the search for the culprit, and again when, by the
evidence of the missing finger, you did not believe
your father was dead."</p>

<p>"Well, you worked; I worked; Link worked,"
said Diana, philosophically, "and we all three did
our best to discover the truth."</p>

<p>"Only to let chance discover it in the long run."</p>

<p>Diana laughed and nodded, but did not contradict
her husband. "Well, my dear," she said, "I
think we have discussed the subject pretty freely,
but there is one thing I should like to know. What
about the Silent House in Pimlico?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Greeb told me the other day that
Peacock is going to pull it down. You know, just
before we were married I took leave of Miss Greeb,
with whom I lodged for a long time. Well, she
gave me a piece of news. She is going to be married,
also, and to whom, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Diana, looking interested,
as women always do in marriage news.</p>

<p>"To Peacock, who owns nearly all the property
in and about Geneva Square. It will be a splendid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>match for her, and Mrs. Peacock, will be much richer
than you or I, Diana."</p>

<p>"But not happier, my dear. I am glad she is
to be married, as she seemed a nice woman, and
made you very comfortable. But why is the Silent
House to be pulled down?"</p>

<p>"Because no one will live in it."</p>

<p>"But it is not haunted now. You know it was
discovered that Rhoda was the ghost, and the ghost,
as Miss Greeb suggested, killed Clear."</p>

<p>"It is haunted now by the ghost of Clear," said
Lucian gravely. "At all events, he was murdered
there, and no one cares to live in the house. I
confess I shouldn't care to live in it myself. So,
Peacock, finding the house unprofitable, has determined
to pull it down."</p>

<p>"So there is an end to the Silent House of Pimlico,"
said Diana, rising and taking her husband's
arm. "Come inside, Lucian. It grows chilly."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tho' winds be cold and nights be drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet love makes warm our hearts, my dear,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Lucian, as they went up to the house. "That
is not very good poetry, but it is a beautiful truth,
my love."</p>

<p>Diana laughed, and looked up proudly into the
bright face of her husband.</p>

<p>So they went inside, and found that Miss Priscilla
had made the tea, and all were very happy, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>very thankful for their happiness. In this condition,
which is sufficiently pleasant, I think we may
leave them.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
